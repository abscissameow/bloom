 Let x be the total cost in dollars.Then, let w be the cost in a bag of treats and u be the cost in a bag of piñatas.Putting the constants in the equations gets us w x + (3 * x + 5) u = 146 w x + 3 * x u = 90 w x + (7 * x + 5) u = 108When the coefficients of the equations cancel,we have w = (13*10)/9 = 1.5u = (9*10)/5 = 1.7,so the total cost is 1.5 * 1.7 = 2.1.With the $13 they spent on the piñata and the $6 they spent on the oranges, the total cost was 2.1.Therefore, the total cost was 2.1.You'll notice that the $13 is moved to the x, as well as the 3 and 5 from the equation. Translating this logic to the ultimately#

 B = 8*(5 + 3) + 7*(9 + 5)$$\because 8 bags of Reese's + 3 bags of Snickers + 5 bags of Skittles = the cost of the piñata and all the treats together.Therefore, the total was $53.In other words, $$8*(5 + 3) + 7*(9 + 5) $$ $$ = $53.$$question: Worker A is producing 5 widgets a day and Worker B is producing 6 widgets a day.

In Australia, the total number of coronary revascularisation (coronary artery bypass grafts and percutaneous coronary intervention) procedures performed over the period of January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2005 increased by 48% (1). Among them, the number of percutaneous procedures was 8.5% of revascularisation procedures. The increasing prevalence of angina pectoris led to an increased number of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, specifically those#

 Let P be the number of treats.Then 6 * ($9 + $5 + $7) = 185.Subtract 1 from both sides as you know the total cost was $13 and the piñata cost $13.Thus 33 + 45 = 54.Then let x be the price of the piñata.Then the cost of the 4 bags of Reese's for $15, 3 bags of Snickers for $25, and 5 bags of Skittles for $37.The total cost is 144, so x = 54/100 = 5.Then let y be the number of bags of treats.So 16 x = 16.Then let z be the number of bags of Reese's.So 4 x = 4, and finally let a be the number of bags of Skittles.So we have 2 x = 2 + 2 x = 2 * 7 + 2 x = 23.The value of x, y, z, and a are 5, 4, 6, 26#

 To find the complete cost we need to add all of the treats cost to the piñata. so.79 = B + C.Then there are no treats left.This will give the cost of the piñata.13 + C = 17[$i$].The total cost of the piñata is 33.The last value of C is $3.So the total cost of the entire celebration is 53 + (3)$ = 52.Therefore, the complete cost of all of the items was 52 + 13 = 69.The answer is 69.question: The zoo fee is $64 overage.  It's worth 80. So what is the fee?answer: $ 50(overage) − $64 = $36(#

 If you think of currencies, each bag of snickers, Reese's, and Skittles set off one cone of the piñata and sets off 1 dollar.  Letting C denote all treats, C = Sum(Snickers,Reeses, and Skittles)Also let E denote the unicorn piñata, E = $4*13 = $40Let M denote the smallest amount Carla needed and will get out of her parents, M = Sum((char*Bonuses)Conversation())Let P denote the parent's money that may be spent on what Carla will just be able to buy with M, P = $40Smaller of M and P, M--P, is the smallest amount of coins in a pile array of#

 Starting at the top, the total cost would be 13 + (4 x 9 + 4 x 5 + 5 x 7) = $52.Toggling the last term to the other side of the equation gives 13 + 52 = 81.Toggling inside the parentheses also gives 52 = 81 + 13.Factoring the whole equation, we have (81 + 13) / (2 x 13) = 13 x 13 / 2.Then, divide the latter equation commas so the equation simplifies to (13 x 13) / 2 = 24 x 13 / 2.Solving this gives (13 x 13) / 2 = 9 x 13 / 2 = 3,540.Then, interacting the last term with the parentheses produces 13#

 From the information given, the cost of the piñata is 8,100, and the $3 worth of Reese's is 123, while the $4 worth of snackers' is 84.Total = 8100 + 123 + 84 = 1445.The answer is 1445.</s>#

 Let T be the total cost of the items. Then T =6r + 9p +5q + 7y.Where r is the total reward, p the total price and q the total quantity. So the total reward is 6r = 3 * 9 + (4 - 2) * 5 + (5 - 2) * 7.The total quantity is q = 5r + 1p + 1q + 1y = 19r + 2p + 1q + 1y
Let T = 6r + 9p +5q + 7y.Then, we get 6r + 2p + 5q + 7y = 3*9 + 4 * 5 + 3 * 7Thus T = 36r + 15p + 3q +14y.Then we must find the two unknowns using the rules of algebra.So, it becomes 36r + 15p + 3q +14y = (3*9 + 4 * 5 *7) - (6r +9p+5q + 7y) = (7*5 + 3*4)- (3*9 + 4 * 5 *7 + 4*6) = (39-8)- ( 3*9 + 3 *7 + 4 * 6)#

 Let C be the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats. Then 13 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 = C Because 55 = C.To figure out the cost of 10 bags of Reese's, we pin the left side over the top and distribute the cost of 1 bag to 2 bags and quotient.We have 2 x $9 = $18 and the cost of 1 bag would be $18 / 2 = $9.Therefore, the cost of the 10 bags of Reese's is C = 53 x 9 = $453.Combine the like constants on both sides, ie C + B = C + (15 + 90) = (53 + 1705) = 555.Therefore, the cost of the piñata and the treats would be C + B = 555.The answer is 555.question: Nina was at her favorite playground.

 Let rgba be the unicorn piñata, let colour be the snacks, Let B 1 be the bags of Reese's, let B 2 be the bags of Snickers, let B 3 be the bags of Skittles, Let group be the number of groups, And let A be the number of bags in each Bag group.Ra diga cost group. Therefore, the cost of the piñata as a mixture of basics would be 9*(1+(9/100)*(1/10)*(1/10) + 4/(21/100) + 3/(21/100) + 5/(21/100)) = 1.98$ (1.9 dollars) fact: 1 is 1.98 times 10, 2 is 4 times 10, 3 is (20/100)*10, and 4 is 3 times 20/100 or 1/10 (10%).The answer is 1.98$.

 The piñata cost 13 + 4 x 5 = 13 + 15 = 26.The treats cost 9 + 5 x 3 = 9 + 13 = 24.Therefore, the total cost is 26 + 24 = 54.2x.The answer is 54.</s>#

 Let A be the price of the unicorn piñata. Let B be the price of the book of candy. Let C be the cost of the bag of candy. Let D be the number of bags of Reese's, Skittles, and Snickers.So, the cost would be A + 3*B + 5*C + 5*D.Using the equation: infinitive multiplication A + 3*B + 5*C + 5*D = 33.Divide both sides by 3 to get:C = Hamburgers + apples + playschool + candy.So, the cost would be A + 3*13 + 5*9 + 5*7 = 1.5.To solve for the price B, we have 1.5 + 54 + 28 + 13 = 44. Therefore, B = 44.The answer is 1.5.</s>#

 The four bags of Reese's cost $9 + 5 * 3 = 27.The three bags of Smirks cost $5 + 3 * 5 = 15.The five bags of skittles cost $7 + 5 * 7 = 52.And since there are 56 treats, then the unicorn piñata costs 13 + 56 = 77.The answer is 77.Question 6: This photo of Ruby and her mom jeans is part of a series of photos Southwar's sis posts.

 The unicorn piñata's cost was 13 bu 4 bags of Reese's for $9 each, so the price would be $4.3 pieces of Reese's and a unicorn piñata.Then we needed 3 bags of Snickers for $5 each so the price would be $2.5 each piece of Snickers and a unicorn piñata. Then we needed 5 bags of Skittles for $7 each, so the price would be $1.5 each item of the snack baskets.So we need a piñata for $4.3 and $3.5 each snack basket, so the total cost is $14.3.So the total cost of the piñata plus the treats was $14.3 + 8 = $#
