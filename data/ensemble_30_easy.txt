 Let u be the number of pizzas that all the five of them share.Then 48 - u - 26 = 8.Let v be the number of pizzas that Cate, Dale and Ann share.Let w be the number Odin shared with Cate, Dale and Ann.Let x be the number of pizzas that Bill does not eat.The total number of leftover pizza is thus 3x + 8 + w = 46.divide the last term by the first two terms, and we have (x - v)/(u - x - w) = 1.The number of pizzas that Bill does not eat is thus 46/(u - x) = 1/(2*4 - 1) = 1/24 = 0.2.The number of pizzas that Dale and Ann share is ((u - x)/(1 - 2*v)) * ((w - x)/(1 - 2*u)) = 82/(2 - 2*v) = 0.26.#

 There are 8 pieces left.The pizza is cut into 4 pieces so there are 4 items left multiplied by 8 pieces left = 32.There are 8 items left to divide by 4 to give us a single item.The single item is part eaten so 2 * 32 = 64.The items not eaten are still 4 so 4 * 64 = 256.Therefore, there are 8 left uneaten.The answer is 8. There are no O levels as a result. formFactor=[formFillUnits];#

 Let x be the amount of pizzas eaten by Ann and Cate. So, 5 * 1/2 + 5 * 3/8 = 2 * x pizzas each.Combining the 2's produents, we get: 4 + 2 * x = 10 pizzas.Let y be the amount of pizzas eaten by Bill. So, 10 - 5 - 2 * x = 5 pizzas.Then the final answer is 5 + 10 = 15 pizzas.Question: If you want to round a number up to the nearest whole number#

 Let fx = Bill and Dale's pizza portions. Let fy = Ann and Cate's pizza portions.Then, 63 - fx - fy = 87 - fx - fy.Combine fx and fy terms to get (65 - 87) / (22 - 2 + 1) = fxfy.Let fx = 21 and fy = 6.Then, fxfy = = 21/6 = 3. Therefore, the portion left un-known or un-eaten of the pizza is 3.And the pizza is 21 – (281-6) = 241 pieces.The answer is 241.</s>#

 Let B be the number of pieces not eaten. Therefore, M - B = 3 - 4 = 1.Now convert the second equation to first-occurrence variables to form  M - A + C = T.Thus, A + C = T.1 + 3 = 4.Therefore, T = 3.The answer is 4.question: Irwin had 3 × 5 + 6 = 21 rhyming words and 5 × 4 = 20 rhymes.

 Let x be the  number of pizzas left.  Let y be the  number of pizzas given by  Bill and Dale  /  (15 + x).Then the number of pizzas  given by  Cate and Ann  /  (25 + x)  can be  rewritten  as  y  =  (15 + x)  / (55 + x).The  total  number  of  pizzas  left  /  how  many  are  given by  Bill  and  Dale  is  x  (15 + x) /  (55 + x), and the  total  number  of  pizzas  given  by  Cate  and  Ann  /  (25 + x)  is  y  (25 + x) / (80 + x).  Thus,  x  (15  +  x)  /  (55 + x) +  y  (25 + x) / (80 + x)  =  (55 + x)  /  (80 + x), #

 Let L be the total number of pizza pieces left un eaten. Then 73 - L = 25.Distributing 75 to 3 yields 73 - 75 = 25.The number of pieces eaten by each friend is L = 25 - 12 = 13.Thus, there are 53 - L = 37 pieces left. Therefore, Cate and Dale each ate 13 and Ann ate 13 + 2 = 15 pieces of pile. The total amount the friends ate is 21. The total number left is 38. The answer is 21-35 = 8.Why do you put up with people that are so prescientless on feeling.

 If 3 = 1/2 (Ann + Cate), then from the pizza leftovers, 3 x 50/100 = 0.5(Bill + Dale) pizza pieces are left.3 x 75/100 = 0.75 (Ann + Cate) pizza pieces are left.Now let A and B represent the pizza left for Bill and Dale, respectively. Then A + B = 0.5(Ann + Cate).If the pizza pieces that are handed to Ann and Cate are divided into 4 pieces, then 3 x 100/4 = 0.25. Thus, 2.25 = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0 = 0.5(Ann + Cate), so they are eaten 50% by Ann and Cate. If they are divided in 4 smaller portions for each of Ann and Cate, then the converse statement proved the answer is 2. The answer is 2.question: Chris was working on a bicycle frame, and his dad asked him to feed the#

 Let A, B, C be the number of pizzas that is left for each consumer: A=b and B = c.Then, A = b + c -1 = 3 slices.B = 2 c minus A = 5 slices.C = 3 c minus B = 3 slices.When these values are added, we get A + B + C = 6.Because the pizza cut into 4 pieces, that equals a total of 4 slices plus 6 little pieces - 6 = 12 slices (that enough slicen to cut into 4 pieces). Then A = 3 slice + (122- 5) = 10 slices left.B = 15 slice - 10 slice = 5 slice left.C = 3 slice - 5 slice = 2 slice left.To account for the things leftover each day, we must divide this by 3.Therefore, Ann had 2 slice for her slicer day, Bill had 0 slice for his slice day and Dale, Cate, and Kelvin had 1 slice each slice day#

 Let m be the number of pieces that Ann and Cate ate. Let n be the number of pieces that either Bill or Dale ate. The number of pieces left unsold is 2*64 - (m + n).Then 2 * 64 - 8m + 78n = 2*64 - (8m - 1) + 78(m - 1)nSo, the number of pieces left unsold would be n = 2*64 - 8m - 78(m - 1) = 4*64 - 63m + 78(m - 1).But the number of pieces that Ann and Cate ate is 75 = 4 * 64 - 63m so n = 38.Therefore, the total number of pieces left unsold is m + 38 = 56 pieces.The answer is 56.education experts on offer:</s>#

 Share of pizza = 8/4 = 1 (piece).Then share of Bill = 8*3/4 = 2 (pieces).Then share of Dale= 8*(3/4) = 3 (pieces).Then share of Ann = 8*(1) = 1 (piece).Therefore, we have 4 = 2 + 3 + 1 = 5 pieces.The answer is 5.question: Max lost at chess with Brian, Jack, and Dave.
