 Let S be the total number of trees, and let E be the number of mango trees and C the number of coconut trees.Then S = 60 + 5 = 65.2 = E + C.S = E + C When this expression is divided by 2, we get S = 40.E = 35C = 15.And this sum is S = 40 + 15 = 55.Then, we throw away 5, so S = 35.Then, we throw away 5, so S = 35.After we throw away 5, we get S = 35.Answer: timber, 35.

 Let x be the number of mango trees that Randy has.Then, there are x + 1/2x = 80 trees.Let B be the number of coconut trees that Randy has.Then, there are 80 - B = 70 trees.Summing up constants gives 40 = B +  (80 - B )So, the number of all the mango trees at Randy's farm would be x + 1 / 2 x = 80 + 1 / 2 x + 1 / 2 x = 70 + 3^2 x if you use the absolute value operator. So, x is 30 trees, B is 12 trees, and x + B + 1 / 2z = 70 + 12 + 30/12 or 10x plus 20x plus 20 = 70. To solve eventually, you could run 3^2 through the larger equation to obtain1 / 2 x = 18. Then solve by substitution. The answer is 10x.question: Dave gave 700 cotton balls to his friend Joey to decorate a baseball stadium. Joey#

 Let x be the number of trees that Randy has.Then, 60 - x - 5 = 35.Combining constants produces 25 - x = 35.To solve, let x be 25.So 35/15 = 2.The answer is 2.#

 Let x be the number of mango trees.Then Let y = x - 3.So, Let A = x - 3 + 5 = 85.And B = x - 6 + 5 = 85.Adding A to B produces 64 + 85 = 126.Subtract 65 from B, so the value of A becomes 65 - B = 12.Therefore the number of trees that Randy has in all is 95 - 12 = 83.Question is 83.Required Level = Grade 5.Math Subdomains = Grades 1-5.Lesson # 35.Factoring In PracticeCalculators and algebra books help you find out if a particular expression is an integer or a composite number.

 Let R be the number of mango trees. Then 60/2 = 30 trees.Subtracting 50% from R yields 30 - 5 = 25 (trees).Add the chopped trees to both sides of the equation to arrive at 30 - (5 + 25/30) = 3.Then Transfer 5 to the left side and 2 to the right side.This yields 3 - 4 = 2.The value of x is 2.Therefore, there are 2 trees less than half as many mangoes and 2 coconut trees as mango trees.The answer is 2 trees.Question 1discount - Not Goal: - How many shops equal 2: two

 If 5 is subtracted from 60 it becomes 45.Subtracting 2 from 45 generates 28.Then subtracting 3 from 28 results in 23. Therefore, Randy has 90.The answer is 90.question: Dave Brooklyn will be driving your car#

 Let C be the number of coconut trees.59/2 = C/4Let ro be the number of mango trees.60/2 = ro/4Let n be the total number of trees. C + ro + n = n + C + ro.Therefore, northern n = (C + ro)/4 and southern n = (C - ro)/4. Since both of these are 2, the number of all trees is 2 * (C + ro)/4 = 2 * (68 + 9)/4 = 52.The answer is 52.question: Gary bought 27 cartons of hamburger buns to sell. Of these 27 cartons, he sold 20, and he sold 10 of them in 5 weeks. On his 7th week,#

 Let N M G or C be the total number of mangoes, mango trees and coconuts respectively.Then 6 G + 5 C + 2 N = 60.Which is equivalent to 1 + M + 1 G + 1 C = 60.Thus, the number of mangoes, mango trees and coconuts on Randy's farm would be G1 + M + C2 = 60.The answer is 60.question: Walker had 300 apples to feed his 200 chickens. He had no apples left to#

 Let x be the number of mangoes. Let y the number of coconuts. Then x + y = 60.Temos 5 less than half the number of mango trees to coconut trees, so the expression becomes 60 - (35) = 25.Subtracting 5 from both sides produces 25 + 5 = 30.If you then multiply by 2.5 gives 75, which is half of 80.Therefore, there are 25 + 2.5 = 35 mango trees and 75 coconut trees.The answer is 25 + 35 = 55A student called his teacher and informed her he had been thrown out of his row home a week prior. His father had kicked him out due to his substantial debt statements.Below are other income statements from the#

 Let O be the number of mango trees.Then 60 - O - 59 = 5.Since we already know that B = 5, we can use the above equation to get 60 - O - (5*5) = 0.In other words, since we already know that O = 5, the equation simplifies to 0 = 5 - 5/5 which simplifies to 0 = 5. Therefore, O = 50.The answer is 50. :)Thanks for trying!</s>#

 Let x be the number of mango trees and y be the number of coconut trees.Then 1 + 5x = 60.This can also be written as 10x + 20 = 60.Adding both sides gives (20 - 5) x = 60.Thus x = 5 and y = 55.The answer is x = 5 and y = 55.question: 5 warmup sessions of warm-ups and 21 cool down minutes followed by 3 recovery sessions of recovery and 7 recovery minutes.

 Let v be the number of mango trees.Also, let C be the number of coconut trees.Then the number of fruit trees (mango or coconut) is 59 - 5 - 5 = 44.So the expression becomes 59-44 = 11.Then v+C-11=A.Since A equals to [59 - 5 -5], and 44 = 11 + 5, then A = 44.Then v = 59 - 11 = 48.Therefore, the number of fruit trees that Randy owns is v = 48.The answer is 48.question: An observer sees a person push 15 rice bags in 3 minutes.

 Let N be the number of mango trees. Then 60 - 5 - 26 = 59 mango trees.Let M be the number of coconut trees. Then 59 - 5 = 54.The total number of trees is consequently N + M = 144. The answer is 54.question: A poor girl in Pennsylvania worked at a factory for 9 months.  She made 264 dollars. Katie from Houston made 997 dollars in 4 months.

 Let X be the number of mango trees and Y be the number of coconut trees.Then 60 - X - Y = 2.Then Y = 60 - X = 40.Then X = Y - 5 = 45.Therefore, the number of trees is X = Y - 5.So the number of mango trees is 45 and the number of coconut trees is 55.The answer is 45.A beautiful symmetry exists in people of the same weight.

 There are (60 - 5) mango trees.There are (60 - 5) mango trees - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 mango trees in all.The answer is 55.</s>#

 Let x be the total number of trees in all. Then 60 + 5 x = 120.Now, add 50 to both sides. This produces 70 = (60 + 5 x) + 50.Substraction is 59 = 70 - 50= 20.Therefore, x = 60 - 20 = 40.Now, let y be the number of mango trees. Then 60 + 5 x = 120 - 5 x = 100. Thus y = 100 - 5 = 85.Subtracting 80 from both sides produces 125 - 5 = 220.Subtracting 140 from both sides produces 160 - 5 = 145.70/ 140 = 4, which is the fraction of mango trees that is less than half as many as coconut trees.The answer is#

 let N be the number of mango trees. Then N + 5 = 60 - 5 = 55Coconut trees = (60 - 5) - (5 - 5) = 2 + 5 + 5 - 5 = 15.
