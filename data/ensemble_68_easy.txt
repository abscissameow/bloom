 Let x be the number of coins while B represent how many coins with the rest.The objective is to determine B.Let Kangaroo's equation be 140x - 110 B = 440.Noting that x = how much money with the rest, B = how much coins without the rest, and 110 subtracted (440 – number of coins without the rest) = number of coins with the rest.Therefore, B = 140x / 110 = 540/210 = 45.With 15 coins of which 11 are 20 and 4 are 50, used in combination, we have: (15 x 50 + 11 x 20) / 100 = 0. Since 15 total coins are distributed similarly, it is set to 300 to simplify. Then (300 x 400#

 The ratio of coins to be spent on toys is 10:4:20.There are 30 steel balls of 5 cents each, 40 steel balls of 10 cents each and 80 steel balls of 25 cents each, combined in equal groups of 10. Each steel ball costs 40 cents, e.g. 40 x 5-cent steel balls costs $a.Here is an example to 12 x 5-cent steel balls, $a: $a:*/JadiJadi dapat diketahui bahwa pedagang kau yakin akan mendapatkan keuntungan dari rumus trik Binomo Kesederhanaan perhitungan merupakan permukaannya pengahasilan, tetapi sesungguhnya sebenarnya aspek yang lebih penting yaitu meraih kemenangan pada ketika akan menjadi penentu semua.

 Let x be the total number of coins that they have. The number of coins Amalie spends is 3/4 * x. Then let y be the sum of the number of coins that they have and the number of coins that Amalie spends. So x + y = 440. and x + 3/4 * 3 = 160.Adding these produces x + y = 320.Since 3/4 * 3 = 49, the remaining coins Emilie has is 49 - x - y = 59.The value of x is equal to 80 (440 - 160) / 450. Since 0 = 0 = 60, the number of coins that Amalie has is x = 480.The answer is x = 48.question: Suzie sold 5 | half bask#

 Let A be the amount of coins Amalia has. Let C be the amount of coins that Elsa has.Let T be the difference B - C.And reland (X) the common ratio of 10:45.Therefore, (a) 2 * (123/48) = (1.75 √ 48) * T = C /2, and (b) 1/(3x) = 1 + 153/(12 * 5) = 2 * T /129.The first statement (a) can now be rewritten to get the expression: 12 * 3/52 * 115 = T /144.Thus T = 1 - 12 * 3/52 * 115 = 160 - 3 * 47 - 7 * 12 = 22.The equation for T is 160 - 3 * 47 - 7 * 12 = 22.00.The equation for B is 79 - 65 = 22.00.Thus: At the start, the number of coins that Elsa had is 65.The amount that Amalia had#

 Let x be the number of coins that Amalie would have remained with if she spent everything she had on toys.Then the number of coins she would have remaining with if she spent 3/4 of what she had on toys would be x= 440/3 = 279.Multiplying both sides by 10 and dividing by 45 gives x= 1 + 440*10*3/45 = 79.Yes, the answer should be x = 79.question: In a second compound interest transaction, 6 months and 5 months ago,#

 Make the ratio in fractions 10/45.Then, say 10 X 3/8 = 12.Therefore, Elsa has 540 and Amalie has 440/12 = 304.Then they have (2 difference - 1)/(2 difference – 1) = 2/7 difference, so they have 7/4 difference. Therefore, there are 2/7 difference beasts left, and 305 will be used. So Carla has 304 and Buffy has 45/10 = 37 coins.The answer is 37/20 = 2.#

 Let x be the number of coins that Elsa has left.2 x 10² + 3 x 5 = 440.Then, the ratio of coins that Amalie has to her own is.538/10² = 138/140 = 10%5 = 5/10 = 0.50.Then, 3 x 0.50 * 3/5 = 5/5 = 1.25.Hence, Amalie has 1.25 x 8/3 = 4 coins left.The answer is 4.question: On the team#

 This problem asks us to compute a ratio. First, work backwards and solve for the unknown: 2 : 3 : 1 : 5 : 2.  A + B + C + D + E = 14, where A, B, C, D, E = 450, 240, 180,... so: ⌋1 The answer is 4.question: Last Wednesday hermione bought a new pair of shoes for 90 cents and jeans for $85. Her total expenditure was 140. When did#

 Let X be depth Amalie's stockpile.Let Y be depth of coins in Elsa's.Then, we have V(77-8)/X=NAV/(17.5X).Using the fact that V = (NAV + P).Using the linear regression equation of amalie's depth of funds as a function of x, let NAV = 42, let P=A - 8, which means, depth of funds in Amalie is a function of x=X/20.There are 17.5 observations.So, you get17.5/20 = 12 mean squares error.It came into MSE = 0.02341 meaning, you've gotten 2.34 errors from the number of observations you'd gotten.So, you can say that a 95% interval for the mean of Amalie's depth of funds would be (39.15, 56.715).The lower point is less than 40. So, that's (39.15,40).elevationMax is 40#

 Let C be the coin to coin ratio and B the total coins.Then, 15 : (2^C) = 440 : (2^10) = 24448 : (2^45) = 440 : (2^50) = 24064.Adding both sides gives 48 = C + B.Let B = 103 and C = 9.Therefore, there exist three coins (A/9, B/10, and C/10).The number of coins that Amalie has is 24064. The answer is 3.question: Amanda is going for a walk and takes her pile of 20 apples with her and chucks her missing ones in her backpack.

 Let a be the fraction of coins to Amalie has.Then a = 11:30 = 300 of the coins.Then let b be the ratio of coins that she has to that which Elsa has. b = 45:10 = 4.5.Then the number of coins that she remains with would be a * b / 300 = 4.5:300/4.5 = 75 of the coins.The answer is 75.question: Elsa and Amalie have the same number of coins, 2a coins, but#

 Let a = the number of coins that Amalie has C = the number of coins that Elsa has M = the total number of coins.So, Amalie has a + 2 * C + 4 * M = 440 a = 440 + 3 * C + 6 * M = 840.Let P be the number of coins that Amalie spends. 35/18 = 2.Therefore, the number of coins that Amalie must have is 840 - 2 * 45/60 = 1.8 * (440 - 45/60) = 24 coins to spend.The solution is 24.question: Two teams of football players equal to 25 people, played a game against each other last week. First, one team earninged their ball back and had 8#

 Let the numbers be C and V so V = 440/3, C = 440/10 = 430, and the ratio be 10:45  so,C/V = 10:45=2030 45 = 10345*0.7 = 3584320 = 862.75 Sterling coins.Answer: E = 862.75S = 3584320.The answer is 862.75S.The task focuses on the ratio of cheeses to green cheese. The ratio is 10:45. The total number#

 Let x1 be the number of coins that Amalie has. And let x2 be the total number of coins that exist.Then x1 = 440 -x Patients that Amalie spends her coins on toys will become x1 / 10 = 14 coins.Then the total sum will now be 14 x 73 = 729 and so each patient will have 43 coins.The answer is (43/60) x 90 = 27 coins.Therefore, the number of coins that Amalie has is 27/50 = 6 coins.#

 Let A be the coins that Amalie has. Then 440/10 = 40A.Therefore, A is 40 coins.Let B be the coins that are left for Amalie. Then (440 - B)/10 = 40(1 - B).Therefore, 40(1 - B) = 440 - 8 = 402.Now let x be the number works: x = (B + 8) /40 = B/2 = 4.Therefore, Amalie has 4 coins, and they have gone to 4 shows so the ratio is: 4/2 = 2.The answer is 2.
