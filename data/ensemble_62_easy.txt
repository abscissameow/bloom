 It is easy to notice that if we split the overall oil number into two half parts, then each half has a size of (290 / 2) / 8 = 59 liters.Then the remaining cans have a size of ((290 - 59) / 2) / 8 = 11 literseach.The answer is 11 liters.The problem has to do with how are the cans divided into half parts in the bad situation.That is to say, 273.5 and 25 are the '#

 Let C be the filling size of each can, D be the amount of oil contained by each can.Then: (C + 8) * 29/10 = 12 liters of oil.Combining constants produces C * 29 + 8 = 128 liters or 8 cans of 12 liters each.For D, 8 liters = 8/12 Tamil liters = 75 li.Therefore, the amount of oil contained by the remaining cans is 128 + 75 = 175 T.L of oil.The answer is 175 TL. (tamil liters)Question #4: The sum of the area of these ten rectangles amount to 150 Square metres. If Cries 1 rectangle size is dem square metres, from the figure we can deduce Fores numbe area#

 Let S be the amount of oil in each can. So 28*S = 40.Then 4+10*8/240 = 8.The answer is 8 liters. question : At her yard sale, Sheila sold all of her 50 chairs for $18#

 Let (C,1), (C,2), (C,3), (C,4), (...), (C,29) be the number of cans in the oil.So, there are 14 (1+C,1) = 14 cans in the oil and thus 14 / (1 + 10/8) = 0.5.There are 28 (2+C,1) = 28 cans in the oil and thus 28 / (1 + (50 - 8)/8)/2 = 1.5. There are 29 (3+C,1) = 29 cans in the oil and thus 29 / ((2 + (50 - 8)/8)/2) = 1.5. There are 30 (4+C,1) = 30 cans in the oil and Thus 30 / ((3 + (50 - 8)/8)/2) = 1.5.  The formula continues...Answer: One can holds 8 liters of oil. Therefore, one can of oil contains 5.26 liters of#

 Coded in the arithmetic model, this is290 - 8x = 242 liters.712 = 10(8x) x 8 liters, so the oil filled 14 + 8x = 20 cans.The answer is 20.question: Miles#

 Let x be the number of liters in one can.Then the required number of cans would be 12.Subtracting 10 from both sides becomes 12 - 8 = 4.Therefore, there are 4 liters in each of the remaining cans.The answer is 4.question: Floyd, Larry and Tom ripped off the bank exchange system by passing fake checks to it. 16 checks were authorized out of 80 received. After paying taxes, Floyd, Larry and Tom were each left with 70% of#

 Let x be the amount of oil in each can. Then 8x = x (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8) = 290.Now, let y be the number of cans since we have 1/2 x per can. Therefore, 9 products of 1/2 x = y = 1/2 x (1/2 x + 1/2 x + 1/2 x + 1/2 x + 1/2 x + 1/2 x + 1/2 x) = 8x = 290, so y = 8.Since we have 8 x = 290, we also have y = 290.Therefore the number of cans is y - 8 = 22.The answer is 22.question: Cape Town has been round about 500 years. Abraham Lincoln went to mill at that date. How old#

 Let x be the number of 8-liter cans, Y be the number of cans that held 4 liters, and Z be the number of 6-liter cans, then 425 - x - 2x + z = 24.Because there are 9 liters in a 9-liter can, y = 13.Because there are 8 liters in a 8-liter can, therefore x + z = 9.Therefore, 425 = 39 + 9 + 8 = 75.Thus, each of the remaining cans is holding 6 liters.The answer is 6.question: During Earth day, Alex saved some green energy by turning on lights when he opened and closed his front door. If Alex recouped 33 kWh from this, then how many kWh#

 Let a be the number of liters that the 20 cans holding 8 liters each contain.Then there are 20a liters in the remaining cans.Because a is the same for ALL the cans, the final result would have been 20a*240 liters = 3480 liters of oil.Therefore, the cars' total would be 40 + 3480 = 6120 liters of oil.Then, divide by 2 so we have 36380 = 3 more cars than that.Let y = the number of cars. Then the number of cars each of the cans holding will be y*28 = 56.The final result would have been 56*240 liters = 190380 liters of oil, less the 24 cans; which were#

 Let x be the number of remaining cans on the jar.Given that they are 8 liters per individual can, then we have (x + 8) = 290.Combine like terms and distribute 8 to both sides, which yields (x + 8)/2 = 58.Combine like terms again, which yields x = 7.Then distribute 7 to the 24, which yields 244 (the number of filled cans that we were looking for).The answer is 7 cans of 8 liters each.question#

 Let x be the number of cans holding 8 liters of oil.Then 290 - x or 290 * (1 - x) -- 22.5 Liters.So, 22.5 liters is each of the remaining cans holding. The red cans hold 4 liters of oil. The green cans hold 3 liters of oil. The black and blue cans hold 2 liters of oil. The diameter of the coins is 2 inches long.The diameter of the assorted toy car is 5 inches long.Each assorted toy car has twice the length of coins.

 One can holding 8 liters can be equivalent to 10 cans divided by 8. So when there are 10 cans, there are 76 liters of oil. So the number of cans that were left when there were 24 cans was 240 - 8 = 208.The answer is 208.question: Dee was at 1 mile of the marathon's end when he stopped running.

 Let C be the total amount of oil.Then, 10x = 80 and x(240 - 80) = 60.Let S be the number of cans that are empty.Then, S = 8 * (240 - 80) = 12 (liters)The value of x can now be found. Add the 8 liters hidden beneath the 10 empty cans to the 60 liters that remain: 80 + 12 = 122.question: Today is Valentine's Day. Everyone got some gifts from their family member.

 Let a be the number of cans that hold 8 liters each. Then :160*8 = a*240 = a*244 = a*244 (5).Distribute 24 to a to get : a = 240/( 240/10) = 5 So 8 can hold 5 liters each.Let X be the number of can that are empty.Then :15 = 304 - 8 = 6.Answer : There will be 6 empty cans, with 4 remaining cans each with 8 liters.#

 Let the amount that each of the 24 cans is holding be C.Then 810/24 = 28 C.Summing the constant term gets 320/24 or 120 C. Crossovering terms gives 210/24 = 70 C. Setting the two equations equal, we find 70 - (120 C) = 30 C. This simplifies to C = 30.Then the all the paint cans are holding 30 liters. Therefore, they are the same size.They are also equally tall. The answer is 14 Canadian pints.question: Alice and Bob played games for 3 quarters of 5 minutes each.
