 She paid $18 for the shoes then her budget was $220 - 18 = 182.She spent 38 on a suit coat and had stockpiled 16 items to beat a possible last-minute price increase to save money. This cutting was rejected and she decided to purchase a belt in order to complete her appearance. The cost of $18 adds another $52 to her budget. And, regarding the belt, her initial budget was $146 - 9 = $120. Seeing what additional costs it came with, she put in an extra $13.So her final cost of purchases was: ($200 - $10 + $38 - $13) + ($46 - $12 + $18 - 13) + ($11 - 3 +#

 Let x be the price of the shoes.Then, there are (x - 16)+36 = 78 = x - 16.Therefore, Alexis paid less than $78.Or, when Alexis paid for the shoes total cost was $78 - 16 = 58.In a different story, Alexis owns a special ocean blue shirt that costs $18 to purchase and $150 or more to sell. She pays $10 for it on one day and sells it for $132 the next day. To make $50 with her shirt in a week, she must sell three shirts for $93 on the first day and five for $103 on the second day. She must pay 27 for the shirt and 65 for the shipping. Is it possible for her shirt#

 Let x be the value of the shoes.Then, the value of the button-up shirt would be (x + 1) * $30.The value of the suit coat would be (x + 1) * $46.Then, the value of the suit pants would be (x + 1) * $38.Then, the value of the socks would be (x + 1) * $11.And the value of the belt would be (x + 1) * $18.Therefore, the equation would become (x + 1) * 30 + (x + 1) * 46 + (x + 1) * 38 + (x + 1) * 11 + (x + 1) * 18 = (x + 1) * x + (x + 1), which could be simplified into the form x(3 + 2).Add the constant 26 to both sides: x(3 + 2) + 26 = x(3 + 2) + 38 - 26 =#

 Let x be the amount of money Alexis spent on the shoes. Then the amount of money on other clothes must be x - $16 = −44.It must have also been x + $18 = 44 Therefore, x + 44 = 78 so the answer is 78 dollars.question: Ben and Hughie drove for four hours to visit the Apple Products Company. As a treat, the company sent them two bags of apples. They ate six of them, leaving the others for later. Hi Hugh#

 Let x be the amount paid for the shoes, so x = ($18+11) - C6$1811 -.Net the left side of the equation = 46 + $38 = 100.Combine like terms on the left side produced 46 + $100 = 116.Then transfer 33 to the right side to make it 114.Then transfer 100 to the left side to make it 106.Finally subtracting $116 from $102 produces $9.Therefore, Alexis paid $106 - $116 = -$9 for her shoes. The answer is -$9.Question 1: Sheila was charged with stealing $36. She paid the amount after hours back to the shop. If she made a false statement again, then she was charged with $#

 Let c be the cost of the shoes (18)and let B be the amount of cash she had remaining from her budget (16).Thus, 66 - c = 16.Now, let y be the price of the button-up shirt and let p be the price of the trousers.Then 69 - c = y.Then 57 - c = p.Thus, let 57 - c = p - y.Then, let 57 - y = c - B.Then y = 23.Then let 89 - y = c - 43.The answer is 50.Welcome</p>To any quiz questions and informations, please visit.</p></s>#

 Let y be the price of the shoes. Then y = $18 + ( $11 / 1.5 ) = $18 + ( $36 / 1.5 ) = $60. The price of the suit pants would be $46 + ( $38 / 1.5 ) = $113. The total price of her clothes would be y + x.The resulting expression would be ( $16 / 1.5 ) + ( $113 / 1.5 ) = ( $16 / 1.5 ) + ( $48 / 1.5 ) = ( $16 / 1.5 ) + ( $72 / 1.5 ) = $16 / 1.5 + $72 / 1.5 = $16 / 1.5. Considering the usual notation, 72 / 1.5 = 45. Thus, when the shoes are considered, the total cost would be $16 + ( $112 / 1.5 ) = $24. The price of the#

 Let x mean the cost of the shoes that she bought.Let y mean the cost of running the 10%.So x+y = 183 - 202 = 11.Using the value of y gives x = 11 - 11/10 = 9.And substituting the value of x, gives the desired result.The answer is 9.question: Barry cannot read at night, so he asks his best friend, Doug, to read to Barry. They meet every day. But, when Doug comes, after reading#

 Let x, y, and z be costs of each of above items.Each of the items are separate and independent so they contribute to a final total.So, x is $30 + 11 + z=47 + (18 - 3) = 54.Therefore, the total cost of all the items was 54.The shoes cost z = 18 - 3 = 11.A person's salary is usually paid in one gross paycheck, which includes 25% of federal funds and social security. A part of her contract specifies that she can choose how much of that gross pay she expects to receive, which is separate from the bonus and other extra money. Assume that in tax year 2004, Alexis earned wages of $10,000 gross and $22,000 personal.#

 Let S be the amount spent on shoes after deducting the price of the shoes, the costs for the shirt, pants, coat, and belt without shoes, and the cost of socks. Let C be the amount spent on the business clothes (button-up shirt, suit pants, suit coat, belt, and shoes) without shoes to wear to the interview. She has S + C = $200.Therefore, this must equal S+2=$180.And you have subtracted shoes from C.Using the unit conversion, the S and C are both two dollars and 20 cents.That becomes $2.20.The answer is $2.20.question: A car washes every week at a price of $9. If the vehicle#

 Let x be the number of shoes that she did not purchase.Therefore, she paid x + (180 - 38 - 11) = 146.Then let y be the number of $18 belts she did not purchase.Therefore, she paid 166 -18 = 134.Adding $13 to both sides for denoting belts, the equation becomes y+(x + (180 - 38-11)) = 180.Adding 178 to both sides for denoting shoes results in (y + x + (180 - 38-11)) + 178 = 180.And adding $14 to both sides for denoting shoes given the shirt's value results in (y + x + (180 - 38-11)) + $14 = 180.There is no negative value#

 The total cost for the business clothes are 138 – $11=131.They cost $46 each off the store's list.So, the total cost for the clothes is 2 * 46 = 96.Now she can purchase the shoes for 12 and the belt for 17.They would cost $26.If she buys 8 socks, she only has $18 left.And she needs to purchase new business clothes for either one of two sets, with a total expense of 81 or 132.As these numbers may not be integers, they must be rounded. In this case, we would round up to 25.Making effective prices ignore the money she already spent on socks.Then, the total price would be 26 + 8 = 32.Therefore#

 Consider the whole shopping trip. Let y be the total money she spent on items. Thus the following budget equation will hold true: (y + 22 + 18) - y = 200 - (30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18) = 12So, y = 12 So, $200 is divided by (12 + 22 + 18) to get (200 / 12 + 22 + 18) = 30Then, each of the items on the shopping list was purchased with part of it (y +22+18) Thus, equating y = (1 + 22 + 18), simplifies to (1 + 22 + 18) = y + unused/2. Using this equation several times, eventually you get the answer of 2..Now#

 Let x be the amount of money that went for the shoes.Then $10+18 = $20.Therefore, the value of x = 20.The answer is 20.question: Let x be the number of men who walked before they pedaled.#

 Let a be the price for the shoes. Let I be the total income from the clothes pays. Let D be the total price of clothes. Let j be the total price of shoes (j > 0) and let k be the total amount spent on buying shoes. Then the total price of the clothes is D + j. And equation can be written as 2a = (clothes + shoes) + (button-up + pants + coat + socks + belt).To solve this, we have to find the order of r D + j.Let the term with the least value be a.Let r amount with the largest value.Let the terms with the second-largest value be b.Beans and b will be the same#
