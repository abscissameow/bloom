 Let A1 be the total in minutes asserted for three times, A2 in minutes proposed for six times.Suppose A1 has 5 days and A2 has 3 days.  Then the sum months would be: 5econds + A1 - A2 = 30minutes.The monthly practice time would be A3 times 30minutes = A3.Therefore, the monthly total practice time would be A3 = A3 = (5 + A1 - A2) × 30 minutes = (7 + 10) × 30 minutes = 660 minutes.Thus, the total 30 minutes of practice lost would be: 30 × 660 sem = 29 days = 2930minutes.Therefore, the number of minutes practiced during a month would be A1 - A2 × 30 minutes = (7 + 10) ×30 minutes/38#

 The piano has 5 minutes a day for 20 days a month(i.e. 5 x 20 days).Therefore, the total time she practices the piano for one month would be 550 (minutes) = 5 x 20 (minutes).The violin has 3 minutes a day for the 30 days of the year (i.e. 3 x 30 days).Therefore, the total time she practices the violin for one month would be 255 (minutes) = 3 x 30 (minutes).If one month consists of four weeks, then the total time for Carolyn to practice the violin in a year would be 595 (minutes).Not one, but six!answer: Let X be the number of minutes Carolyn practices the piano a day.#

 Let B represent the number of minutes she practices. Let x denote the number of weeks in a month.Then because there are 4 the number of minutes a day, 10 weeks, and 4 days: Then B x 10 = 1400 minutes in a month, which is 4 weeks.The average number of minutes she practices in a week is (B/5)/ 10 = 35 minutes per week.Therefore, now all the terms are in proportion. Thus, we have: (,),).To find the value of r, we have B/5 = r* (B/10/25),/ (3/2,/5/5).=.3,15/7,7 =.3,2.So the value of r is:.3*2 =.45.#

 Let X be the number of minutes she spends practicing with the piano. Then 69 - X = 20 months.Because she practices six days a week and there are four weeks per month, therefore she spends 60 minutes a week, or 18h20m520s, with the piano. At 60 minutes a week, the hours are 3600 minutes each month. Therefore the number of minutes she spends practicing with the piano in a monthis 360h =  2160 minutes.Let N be the number of minutes she spends practicing with violi. Then 79 - x = 160 minutes. After subtracting the number of minutes she spends with piano, she has 80 minutes left for practice with violin.This leaves 1640#

 Let y be the minutes practiced with five days of practice.Then y would be 2x in a month.Then, using the Linux summation, the value of yrounded off on the next spot would be 30 minutes a month. So x would be 30 minus 26 = 4.The answer is 4.For reference, if she practices for one hour a day, then y = 30 - 26 = 4.</s>#

 Let x be the time spent in practice in a month.The number of days in a month is 30*30 = 900.The total minutes she practices is 30 * x = 900 x.Let n be the number six days a week they all i=work.Let A be the change in work times when going from day i to day i+1.Then, the total minutes = 30*90*6*11 + 30 * 45*6 +30*236*6 +30*30*6 = (90*6 + 45*6 + 236*6 +30*30*6) * 11i =12 total minutes.A = (90*6 + 45*6 + 236*6 +30*30*6) * 11 - (90*6 + 45*6 + 236*6 +30*30*6) = (90*6 - 90*6 + 45*6 --45*5 - 236*6) * 26 - (90*#

 Let B be the number of days of practice.Then using the product rule we can see that B *.6 = 36.Then let x be the number of minutes per day.Then let C be the time that comes from 5 weeks * 5 days * 20 minutes per day = 600 minutes or 60 hours.Then B=C x 20 minutes per day = 60 x 12 = 720 hours or 72.480 minutes or 480.Thus it would take B = 720 hours + 6= 36 days.The answer is 36 days.</s>#

 Let x be the number of minutes spent watching practice for each instrument.So, Carolyn spends x minutes watching practice each day for the piano and 4x for the violin. Adding the two makes ten minutes every day.Divide this out by the total number of days to find the amount of minutes spent practicing in a month with four weeks.So, Carolyn practices x/10 + 4x/10 = 20 min per week for the piano which is 20% of the total. So, she practices x/10 + 4x/10 + (x/10) = 20/10 + 3x/10 + (20/10) = 2510 10 + 3(10/10) + (20/10) = 50.Then, use negative binary to make all the factors in#

 Let C be the number of practice minutes with Wednesday and Thursday. Then C/4 is the number of practice minutes with Monday and Tuesday. Thus, C/2 is the number of practice minutes on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. From these, we have C = (4 - 2) C - 2. Adding the constants produces C/2 + 4 - 2 = 6.Multiplying both sides with 30/24 gives C/6 = 6/30.So, our original expression becomes 6/3 x 229.To solve, divide both sides by 6 and subtract 2 from both sides.Then flip the signs of the numbers on both sides.Finally add both signs.The second side becomes -6 / 3 x 229 - 2 = -6 / 3x -1.Dividing#

 One day should be subtracted from the result. Namely, there are six practice days (taking into account the fact that there are five complete weeks).Therefore,
six = 20/3

hours practice in a month with four weeks.question: Each blue soccer ball costs $7 and each orange soccer ball costs $8. If we throw 17 orange and 18 blue soccer balls into a basket of 20 soccer balls, the net benefit is $34. If we change the color order so that an average of 7 blue soccer balls and 8 orange soccer balls slip into a basket of 20 soccer balls, the net benefit is $22. How many orange and how many blue soccer balls had to slip into the basket?answer: We have to spend#

 Let y be the number of minutes Carolyn practices the piano.Then she practices 20 x 6 days a week for 52 weeks, in 222 days, which is 231 days in a month.Thus, 387 - y = 231.Adding 231 to both sides of the equation produces 303 - y = 231.To solve for y, we have 233/307 =.6.Therefore, Carolyn practices for approximately 6 hours a day on average.The answer is 6.question: Liam spends $5#

 Let Y be the number of minutes that Carolyn practices. She practices for 20 minutes everyday for 6 days a week which equals 21.5 minutes. The second day is a Wednesday, therefore, Y - 1 is nearly 15 minutes. 2 weeks should be 4x4 = 16 days. Then Y - B = 21.5 - 15/4 = 8.5 minutes. The answer is 8.5 minutes.answer: Let A be the number of apples that Carla ate. Let B be the number#

 Let h be the commits that ممارسة the piano.Then the number of minutes spent practicing the piano is 20 x 3 = 60.Add the time for the violin, and we get 30 minutes for the piano and 21 for violin, so that the equation: possesses the values of h as well.equation is 60 + 30 + 21 = 97 minutes per month, and we have four weeks in a month.  Therefore, the answer is 97 / 4 = 21.hours per week.question#

 In six lessons of ten minutes each, Carolyn would do the piano for (20 + 6) * 10 = 230 minutes.And, with the violin, she would do 3 (21 + 42) = 107 times 20 minutes each.Thus, Carolyn would spend 230 minutes + 107 * 20 minutes = 1046 minutes in total. Summing does the fractions actually gives the answer 1046 minutes.So, in another four weeks Carolyn would need 1046 / 4 = 238 minutes and#

 Let x and y be the number of minutes she practices the piano and violin.We will first find x.Carolyn practices 6 days a week for 35 minutes a day. On two of those days she practices for the piano and on four of those days she practices for the violin. 45 minutes x 25 = 1,500 minutes.The number of minutes she practices the piano on the five other days is 2,000 - 1,500 = 500 minutes.Then we have y.Because she has guest Egyptians coming to play sunday, she practices the violin for 3 times as long that sunday.3 x 50/60 x 8.2 = 2,800 minutestaking the constant out becomes 2,800 / 6#
