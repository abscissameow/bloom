 Iceland is a relatively young nation, with the most recent deadly earthquake recorded in 2010. It had a 7.3 earthquake magnitude.Each earthquake caused more buildings to collapse because it made the ground more unstable.In this case, the total number of collapsed buildings is (3 + 1) * 2 = 5.With the first quake the total number was previously (3 + 1) * 1 = 3. We end up having 5 collapsed buildings after the fourth quake.Therefore, the total is 5 + 5 = 10.The answer is 10.question: On Thanksgiving, there are 54 turkeys in a chicken coop. Noah and his wife Bonnie planned to eat 36 of the turkeys. So Noah cut 18 into 4 pieces of 2, then#

 Let E be the number of buildings collapsed in the third earthquake and let N= 2E. Then we have  (2+E+1)=3E so N=3E.Therefore E=4/2=3.There were four buildings before the first earthquake, two more than before the second earthquake, and three more than before the third earthquake, so the answer is three. -WilliamFreeman - Answer key</s>#

 From the second earthquake on, we'll say that the number of buildings collapsed since the first earthquake equals the sum of the following four values:40 plus 75 plus 55 plus 50 equals 195.The predictions for the first three earthquakes are already known and given. Therefore, we need to write two equations which sum up to a known value.Now we can't avoid look at equation 1 again, since the next predicted value is 50.Summing over the predictions we get 195 = -35 + 25 + 20 + 25.This is not a block equation, but we can ignore the negative numbers. There are four unknown variables, namely, 35, 20, 25, and 25.Therefore, we have a series of four equations with four unknowns and they can be#

 Let x represent the number of buildings that collapsed after the first earthquake. Then: 4 * x = 16 buildings will collapse after the second earthquake.   x + 4 * x = 28 buildings will collapse after the third earthquake...... where y represents the number of buildings that collapsed after the (y + 1) th earthquake. ​ i.e 74 - 14 + 9 = 41 buildings have collapsed.The answer is 41.* PRACTICAL QUESTIONS​(Independent Practice, RA-06)#

 Before the first earthquake, there were x collapsing buildings. So after the first earthquake, there were x + 1 collapsing buildings.After the second earthquake, there were 2x collapsing buildings.After the next earthquake, there were 3x collapsing buildings.And after the next earthquake, there were 4x collapsing buildings.Therefore, after three more earthquakes, there were 4x + 3 = 10 collapsing buildings.The answer is 10.</s>#

 Let S be the number of collapsing buildings. Then S + 2S = 4.  Since the first earthquake only collapsed one building, there is an initial situation S = 1.Thus, #2, S3, #4, S6, #8, and #3 are the collapsing buildings.  They each have double the collapsing buildings of their positive connoteing neighbors (S = 1,2,3,4 and S = 9,8,6).  According to the pattern we are look at number #2 is the same as S + 1 since they both have an additional collapse.  However #3, S5, and S7 are two double collapsing situations.  Thus each of #3, S5, and S7 have two collapsing buildings each#

 Let y be the number of buildings that collapsed after the first quake.Each earthquake was stronger than the previous one by a factor of 2, so each earthquake was expected to collapse additional y buildings following it.Because there are 3 earthquakes, the number of collapsed buildings since the first quake equals 1+3*4 + 3*2*4 = y + 4 + 3 * 2 * 4 = (y+4) * 2 = 2 3y.So the answer is 2/3y buildings had been destroyed. The answer is#

 First earthquake: = collapse buildings = building foundation stability.2nd earthquake: = removal of foundations + 2 new buildings.3rd earthquake: = removal of foundations + 3 new buildings.Therefore, = 4(2 + 3) = 9 collapsing buildings answer = 9.question: Cantrell grew a lemon from a lemon seed started from a lemon cut from a lemon picked from a lemon picked from a lemon that was 25% lemon, 25% lemon juice, and 50% lemon cleaner. As it grew, the#

 Let E be the number of buildings that collapsed after the third earthquake.Then after the first earthquake, E = 1.After the second earthquake, E = 1 or 2.After the third earthquake, E = 3 or 4.Therefore, the value of E = 1 or 2.The answer is 1.question: Three people walked to a concert. They started at 6 in the morning.  They were able to get there after 3.5 hours at 6. Sunny moved faster and arrived first#

 We can't determine the overall number of collapsing buildings. However, since the foundations on the first earthquake were not stable, they would be weak. In the third earthquake, if the previous foundations were weak, then a new effect would come into play: The structure would become brittle. brittle structures are less stable, and each successive earthquake would cause more damage than in the case of stable structures.Our only real "evidence" is the total number of collapsing buildings at a given time.#

 13, 16, 21, 26 from the first earthquake.  In the second earthquake, we have five more collapsed buildings as a result of the previous earthquake. Three buildings are that's 16, that is 9, because there were three earthquakes in the second. That makes the total of collapsed buildings in the second earthquake to be 21 + 9 = 28.Each earthquake has twice the number of collapsing buildings as did the previous earthquake. Therefore, the total of collapsed buildings from the first three earthquakes is ( 28#

 Let x be the number of collapsing buildings after i earthquakes.Then the number of buildings after the first earthquake would be x * 6/12 = x * 1.06 / 12 = x * 0.981 * 6 = 14.4 x 1.06 / 12 = less than or equal to x * 0.96812 * 6 = x * 0.94912.Then there would be two more buildings after the first earthquake producing 16 collapsed buildings.From the second earthquake there would be 14.4 collapsed buildings, which would fall to 13 collapsed buildings after the third earthquake.There would be 13 collapsed buildings after the third earthquake, which would be 12 collapsed buildings after the fourth earthquake.There would be 12 collapsed buildings after the fourth earthquake#

 Let N be the number of buildings collapsed after the first and second earthquakes. Then N = 4*16 - 4*9 = 2.And N = 3*16 - 3*9 = 7 - 1 = 6 for the third earthquake. Therefore, the number of buildings after the third earthquake totals 7 - 1 = 6.The answer is 6.question: There are 4 lines that make up these 12 stripes.  If we want to have 8 stripes in the rind, how many lines can we cut?#

 In the first earthquake, a total of 5 buildings collapsed. In the second earthquake, there were a total of 10 buildings that collapsed, which was double the number of buildings that collapsed in the first earthquake.In the third earthquake, there was a total of 20 collapsing buildings, which was double the number collapsed in the second earthquake.However, 13 buildings did not collapse in the third earthquake, which is the same number that did not collapse in the first or second earthquake. What was the total number#

 Let x be the number of collapsed buildings.Then the number of collapsing buildings after the first earthquake would be 2*x = 2x + 1.So the collapsing buildings after the first earthquake would be 2 + 1 = 3 buildings.Since experts predicted that each following earthquake will double the number of collapsing buildings, the predicted number of collapsing buildings after the second earthquake would be 2*3 = 6.The predicted number of collapsing buildings after the third earthquake would be 2*6 = 12.So#
