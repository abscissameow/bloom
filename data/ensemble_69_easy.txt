 As in the example, we use a little manipulation so that 53 'a''s can be seen. In this case z is the number of arms, so z = 53 - 7 = 30. There are 4 'z''s between each 'a' in the series. Consequently, there are 310 'a''s in total, which makes 226 'z's.Therefore, z = th 0 b a *. * c n n n n n n n n n n n n y m l k 3 n n n n n n n n n n n n n n Code Challenge Programming problems [Zhangwen Li 2]Fortune buffer  programming problem with distinct inwards orientations of arrows by Zhangwen Li on 2017-12-12.

 Let x be the number of starfish with 5 arms.Then x + (3 * 5) + (3 * 4) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 14) = 5 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 14.Thus, x = 5 + 7 + 7 + 14 - 7 = 21.Therefore, there are 21 + 42 = 83 starfish with 5 arms.The answer is 83.question: Harry flip-flopped bitches on his way to school.#

 Carly collected 7 starfish with 5 arms each to make a total of 35 arms. + a seastar with a total of 5 arms = 35 + 1 = 36 to receive one more.So, to calculate the number of stars, we can add one to the number of arms of the seastar.so, the number of elements in the set of starfish with 3 to 9 arms is 7 * (5 + 8 * 5 + 2 * 8 + 2 * 5 + 1) = 158.The answer is 158.

 Let S = {seastars, starfish1, starfish2, starfish3, starfish4, starfish5, starfish6, starfish7}. Then to solve for A(1-2), we have the following equation: 4213 - A(1-2) - 264 = 0.So A(1-2) is 28.Combining terms and simplifying produces the following equation 43 - A = 28.Then after adding A to both sides, the first expression becomes A + (28 - 42) = 43 which simplifies to A - 28 = 42.The answer is 42.question: Jill told this to a baseball fan meeting. Only 3 of the 9 fans know the answer to the following feedback.The first#

 Similarly there are 5+2+4+1 = 6 arms. There are 7 objects so there are 6 * 7 = 49 arms.And there is only 1 starfish so there are 49 / 1 = 49 arms.question: Every team has 5 players and both teams finish the game the same time.  If Team One had 1 player and Team Two had 3 players, how many players did Team One have? Answer: Since both teams finish the game together, both teams have 5 competitors. But each team#

 S = 7 + 5 + 1 = 15.Since 14 bits are combined to get 5 bits, s = 14 / 5 = 2.To get the finished product with final chaining 16 bits, first chain 15 for 30, then chain 4 for 3.Thus the total number of arms the animals have is 		2 + 0 + 2 = 3.The answer is 3.question:  A, B and C are three type A light bulbs where A is 2 times longer and 50% weight#

 Let (1) represent the number of arms Harry collected. Then there are 10 binary numbers, each consisting of a 1 followed by a 0. Thus, each binary number would have the value of 10 * n. Applying this value to the 7 starrfish values gives (7 * 10 * 5 * 5 * 1) = 5,000.The square roots of each of the binary number values evenly divide the sum of all squares. Then the least common multiple of the sizes of the animal collection equals the largest of the binary number values: The binary number with the least common multiple equals (7 * 10 * 5 * 5), since its sum of all squares is the largest (the square root of 1 is 1,000): 5,#

 Let a be the number of arms in a starfish.  Then we have a -5b + 1c = 7.  Decomposing and distributing gives a = 5, b = -1 and c = 14. Then she had 1 starfish with 5 arms and one starfish with 14 arms. Therefore, her animals were composed of only 2 species of starfish.Answer: 7 - 4 - 14 = 2 question : A truck containing 4000 lbs of coffee went from Louisville to Boston. #

 Let x be the total number of arms of the animals she collected.Then the number of arms of the starfish would be 5 + 14 = 19.Then x would have 40 arms less than 19.So it would be 19 - (40/5) = 19 - 4 = 15 arms.So there would be 7 starfish with 5 arms.And at the onset, 1 seastar with 14 arms.Therefore, the number of animals she collected would be 7 + 14 =21.The answer is 21.question: Nizza tossed a 3-sided die 6 times. the first three outcome

 Let x be the number of arms and Y be the total number of arms.Then x + Y = total arms.The total number of arms in the starfish, seastars and the five arms collections combine to make 23 arm animals, so x + Y = 23.Since we have 14 + 5 + 5 = 20 arms, then x + Y = 23 = 2 * 23 = 30 arms.The answer is 30.question: The survey revealed that only 11% of the girls and 13%#

 The number of arms is more than the sum of the 25 arm stars and the (1 + 5) arms of each starfish. Therefore, the number of arms must be more than (1 + 5) + 15 + 14 + 5 = 60.The answer is 60.question: Athos is a football team. Austin is a linebacker on this team Rawhide is the head coach.

 Let x be the number of starfish and y be the number her collected. Then 7 x 14 = 100.Let W be the left side constant.Let L be the number of arms on the starfish and E be the number of limbs on the seastar so, their combined number is L + E.By distributing constants, we get (E + 1) x (y + 1) = 100.Then (7 + 1) x (45 + 1) = 100.Therefore, y=5 x 45 = 270.By distributing the constants back, we get 245 = (y + 1).Therefore, the number of arms is 246 = (7 + 1) + (5 x 45) = 253.The correct answer is 253.question: A drill was used to dig foundations (a hole) worth $5 to the unit.

 Let Q be the number of arms on a seastar. Let E be the number of arms on a starfish with 5 arms. Let C be the number of arms on a starfish with 7 arms. Then Q + E + C = 25 * 5 * 7 = 1982. Therefore, E = 753C + 39Q = 1982 - 25 * 5 = 19 * 5C + 92Q = 24 * 5Q + 83Q = 5Q + 92Q = 6QThe answer is 6.Question 9: Let y be the number of apples produced per $80 of raw material sold and the price of the raw material are $40.
