 Let Z be the number of gallons collected over a day.Then Z = 15*(4 + 3).  And Z, the total number of gallons collected over the four days, is 2 * 4 + 1 * 3 + 4 = 44 gallons of water.Thus, the gross sales of the four days is 44 * 1.2 = 54 dollars.Using rapaz i should have made 54 - 52 = 2 of the water: 2200 * 1.2 = 2350.What did James make selling all of the water?answer: Let Y be the number of gallons known (i.e., the amount that was collected over four days).Then Y = 14 * (4 + 3).The gross sales of the four days#

 Let x be the sales revenue.  So 43 = x 15 gallon = "$13.00." Let's call the revenue Y.  Then: B (15 + 4 + 3) = "Y" where B is the varible Rain Water Collection Bore.We want Y = $1.2.Integrating gives: Y = B - B B = $1.2.Therefore, the sales revenue was Y = $1.2.The answer is 13.question: Welder Mark welds 3#

 Let \(v = [1.2]\). Let g be the number of gallons he collected over the two days.  Thus, g = [15 \times 4]{1.2} = 4 amount of money. Then, 13 -= g = [0.4] = g(1.2) = 1.2(4).Then, \(v = [1.2]{4 + 18/8} = 1.2\) $\颁奖词</s>I. INTRODUCTION
Density functional theory (DFT) is a new approach to treat quantum matter in which the energy of system is written as a functional of the density matrix and only density is demanded, [1] [2] [3] minimized to obtain the ground state.
It has been a long time since the first attempt to describe a quantum many body system using the density function approach. Milton (1938) formulated the Kohn-Sham equations and later, Schrieflinger (1950) formulated#

 Let B be the volume of water that was collected on Monday.  Then only 15 divided by 30! = 0.5 gallons of water were collected on Monday.So the volume on Tuesday would be 0.5 gallons of water.  That equals 15 divided by 2! = 5 gallons of water.See, 15 = 5 + 5.He collected 5 gallons of water on Monday and 5 gallons of water on Tuesday, and he paid $1.2 dollars for every 5 gallons of water he collected.The answer is 5 x.The answer is x = 165.#### after 5 more days, he will be right back at that point.The answer is 9. days 5 x 9 = 99.#### after another 5 days#

 Let Y be the income from the rain. So Y = 1.2 x 7.5 x 4 = 1020.And let X be the total dollars collected. So X = 7.5 x 1 + 14, an income of 374.Adding 3770 to both sides transforms it into 1470 + 1 + 374.So Y = 7.5 x 1 + 7.5 x 1 + 1470 + 1 + 374 = 1.2 x 76 = 1020.Thus, Y = 1020.And Y = 1 = Y.The answer is 1.question: If Charlie and Judy drink 46 cups of tea, an hour then Charlie drinks 20 cups an hour. How many cups does Judy drink an hour after Charlie?answer#

 Let y be the amount of money that James made from selling all the water.  Then 15y = 8.Then 15 is the amount of water he received.  So y = 65.Subtracting B from both sides gives 25 = B - 65.Then the expression becomes 3y = 140.Now let y = 65.  Then the terms cancel, so y = 0.  Therefore, B = 0.  So he made 140 as much money from all the rain.  The answer is 140.question#

 Let x be how much rain James collected on Monday.  Then x = 15 ( rainfall on Monday) x 1.2 / 4 = 960 gallons.  Thus, the amount of rain collected on Monday would be 960 x 1.2 = $1230.Note: Using similar methods, we would have rainfall on Tuesday would be 450 x 1.2 = $450. Adding the consequeced TIRs (3 x 960 = $2400) and selling water for cash, we receive $440.The answer is $440.Source: Complete Book of Trigonometry Question :: Hello Are you looking for the exact answers to your problem then check out Complete book of Trigonometry, many solutions and practice problems with step by step explanations.

 In rain 15 gal = 15 oz. So 4 inches equals 4 * 15 = 60 oz. And 3 inches equals 3 * 15 = 60 oz. In other words, he made 60 oz. on Monday and 60 + 60 = 120 oz.on Tuesday.The next day, he started at 60 oz. and finished at 60 + 60 * 0.8 = 70 oz.  The answer is 70.If we solve the equation 72 / 30 = 4, we find that he collected 4 inches of#

 Let X be the amount of rain collected on Monday.So, X = 15 gallons and then 0.4 = 15/4 = 3 inches.So on Monday he collected a total of 3 + 15 = 18 inches of rain.From Tuesday onwards, X could have been any multiple of 3 inches.  So there are three possibilities for how much rain collected on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.So, the equation would =18/3 x= 1 rain on TuesdayWe add 3 to both sides to make X = 15Now we take the last term from the first equation = 18/1 x = 3 inches from MondaySubtract the amount of rain from Monday over the amount of rain on the related day to arrive at the amount of water collected ----(k#

 Let ρ denote their rainwater collection rate. Let R denote the inches of rain on Monday and suppose R - 3 = 1 on Tuesday.Then, let t be the amount of rain on Tuesday.  Therefore, R - 3-t = 2.  Then let t = 3 on Thursdays and on Fridays.  Let TA denote the amount of rain on any given day.  Therefore, TA = R - t.Then, R - 3 * 3 = 0 so R = 3 + 3 - TA so R = 6.  Therefore t = 0 and on Monday James was collecting 15 * 156. The answer is 6.question: To scale a coaster to size S, write a linear equation.  Assume ratios to absurd, which means they#

 Let W1 be the amount of water collected on Monday.  Then the total amount of water will be 4 inches x w1 (since water weighs 4 gallons per inch) = 4 inches x 1.2 x 15 = 84 gallons.  Then let T be the amount of water collected on Tuesday.  Then the total amount of water will be 3 inches x (w1 + W1) 1/2 = 5 inches x (1.2 x 15) 1/2 + 3 inches x (1.2 x 15) 1/2 = 45 gallons.  N'" = 84 - 4 - 45 = 17 gallons.  Therefore, the price per gallon for all the water he bought will be 17 x 1.2 = $17.00.You calculated the price per gallon correctly, but to get the total amount of money James made from these gallon of water you have to calculate 85 instead of 84.</s>#

 Let a week be the number of days.  Let g be the per-gallon price of water.  Let d be the gallons in the collection barrel.  Let a = 1.2 and let w = 4.  Thus, the per day price of water is w = g(15 a)/(60 d).This, in turn, can be rewritten as 35/w = 1.2 * 15 * d / (60 * a)  Thus 4 w(15a / d / a) or 4 w w(15 g  / 32 a) or 4 w g(15 g / 32 w)/(60 d).This last equation is then solved for w by putting in the unknown expression in step 2 to get: 1 2(g(15d / 15) + 15 a) = g (16d).Solving for $d gives: $d = 2 g (160a).  Thus the total revenue from all the rainwater collection before w is $16.#
