 Let n be the number of coins collected by Joanne.Then there are 3 * 5 + 3 = 15 coins collected during the first hour.There are 7 * 5 + 14 = 35 during the second hour.After the second hour, there are still 50 coins to be collected and 15 coins to be given so :7*50 + 14 *15 = 50 + 50 = 100Thus n = 100.The answer is 100.question: David bought two packages of frozen sweet potatoes.

 First, if she had to collect the coins all of the time starting at 8 am, then how many coins would she have on her watch at 10 am? Let c be the number of coins at 10 am.Then she would have c* every hour from 9 hours, so the number of coins at 10 am is (c* + 1)*12 = 54 coins.The second part of the problem states that Joanne gave 15 coins to Jill. To understand the requirement both parts of the problem have to be explained in the same sentence "We have 100 coins but we gave 15 to Jill." Then, x is the number of coins remaining, c is the number of coins given away to Jill, and y is the number of minutes from#

 Let x be the number of coins she collected during the first three hours. Then 40 + x = 15 during the fourth hour.Thus, x = 35 - 15 = 20.Further, the sum of all 20 coins would be x + 20 = 40.So the expression simplifies to 15(x + 20) = 40.To solve for x, we have 40/15 = x.Therefore, during the first three hours, Joanne collected total of x = 15 coins.The answer is 15.question: The king gave the ending on an 11-month sentence of Joanne money. The last day of Joanne’s sentence was 10 5/9 squares. If Joanne had a more weeks of punishment yesterday, how many people would she be#

 Let x be the number of coins at the start of the fourth hour.Then at the start of the fourth hour, there are x + 2 (the amount of coins given to her coworker) + 15 = 46 coins in total.Adding up the first 3 numbers gives 240 + 2(2) + 15 = 245.Then 240 transactions occurs in the first hour so 245 - 240 = 15.Thus there are 15 coins remaining at the end of the third hour.Therefore, x = 45 coins at the start of the fourth hour.The answer is 45.</s>#

 Let t be the hour of the day.Drawing the equation y = 15t + 50 produces 100/5100 = 23.5.Thus, 23 became the number of coins Joanne collected from the first through the fourth hour. After the fourth hour, let w equal the number of coins Joanne had left after giving 15 of them to her coworker.Solving the equation produces 23t + 50w = 100So w = (500 - 50)/500 = 140.Therefore, on the fourth hour, Joanne had 80 coins and she had given 15 coins to her coworker.Let x = 53.Solving the equation is (53 + 80)(140 + 15) = 53.That is, that was the#

 During the first hour, she collected 15 coins, then during the second hour she collected 35 coins plus 15 coins = 50 + 75 = 95 coins.Then during the third hour, she collected 30 coins. Then at the end of the third hour, she gave 15 coins to her coworker so she had 45 coins at the end of the third hour.Then she started collecting again at the end of the first hour just as she started on the second hour and that continued retroactively. Therefore, she had at the very beginning of the fourth hour 88 coins.There was 15 coins at the beginning of the fourth hour that she had received as a gift from her coworker. Therefore, the answer is 88 + 15 = 123.The#

 For the first hour, Joanne had 15 x 15 coins from the fountain.Also, 45 coins a first hour.For the second hour, she had 35 x 0.2 coins from the fountain.Also 15 coins a second hour because she gave 15 of her own coins to her coworker.So 15 x 0.2 = 3.5 coins for the second hour.For the third hour, she had 50 no matter how many coins that she gave to her coworker.So 50 coins a third hour.So 2 x 0.3 = 0.6 coins for the third hour.Also for the fourth hour, she had 50 x 0.6 = 40 coins or 25 coins. So Alice gave half of the#

 Let X be the coins that Joanne collected in the first hour. Then X = 15.Two hours later, she put on the coins she collected in the first hour, so X = 15 + 15 = 30 total coins collected in two hours = X + X for the total X.Thus, after the second hour, she had 30 + 15 = 45 coins.In the fourth hour, she put on 75 coins, so the total was 45 coins plus 25 coins from her coworker, which added up to 90 coins. So the answer is 90 coins.question: At a school, 70 students took a physics test. Linus and Harry took the same test and Martin who took the same job as Linus took a test where every#

 Let B be the number of coins collected in the second hour. Then, the number of coins collected during the first hour would be 79 - B - 26 = 52 - B = 45.Based on this observation, consider B as the remaining coins in the collection. During the 4th hour, Joanne should have collected B + 40 = 50 coins.Therefore, the number of coins collected during the fourth hour would be 45 + 50 = 95.The answer is 95.question: On a soccer game#

 Let D be the number of coins received in the first hour.Then 2*D = 5 coins were received in the second hour.3*D = 10 coins were received in the third hour.4*D = 15 coins were received in the fourth hour. (14 of the coins were given to the coworker, who purchased a soda)In the last hour, her coworker returned her 49 coins. So, after the fourth hour, she had 49 - 15 = 34 coins (which is the difference between what the coworker returned and what the fountain gave her).The answer is 34.

 Let h be the number of hours from 12:00 noon (12 a.m. to 3 p.m.).So, we have this system of equations: h = 0.15 x h + 0.35xc = 35 x 2.At the beginning of the first hour, she had 15 coins which is 15 x 0.15 = 1 coin.Then, in the second hour, she had 35 coins which is 35 x 0.35 = 15 coins.Let's simplify the expression: (5 + (15 x 1)) + (15 + (35 x 15)) = 50.Now, we subtract from both sides 10 (producing a remainder of 60). We say that 60 divided by the total is h and since the total is 100 we have: h = (50 - 60) / 100 = 0.2Applying the same procedure to other equations, the answer for the number of coins collected at the end of each hour is as follows:4 coins 1/4 /4h = 1 coin#

 First off, what is the decimal form of 105?10.5 = 15.Then after the second hour, the number added to the real part of 105 is 1.5 or 45 which equals 35.We can combine these two parts together to get 65 or the number of coins she had after the first hour.Then afterward, because she gave 15 coins to her coworker she received a number that is 15 times less than 35. Thus, she received (45 - 15) or 30 coins.The answer is 30.question: Brenda and Jeanette's total number of white blisters is 5. Jeanette's total is 3, while Brenda's is 3. If they were to break open a white blister each#

 Let x be the number of coins after the fourth hour.Then, x was 15 coins at the beginning of the first hour (x + 15 = 30 coins).Again, x was 135 coins before she gave the 15 coins to her coworker, so x - 15 = 90 (x - 15 + 45 = 90).So x was 90 coins the first hour, 45 coins in the second hour and then 50 coins from the fountain. Then subtracting 150 (=90 + 20) gives 40 coins left.Let y be the number of coins removed from the collection during the second and fourth hours.Then, y was 40 coins, so y+2 = 50 coins.and the number of coins removed was 50 so y = 35.#

 Let C be the number of coins that Joanne had left at the end of the fourth hour.Joanne began the first hour with 25 coins because she gave 15 to her coworker.Therefore, she had to replace 15 coins with new coins every hour to equal the number of coins that she was giving away to her coworker every hour if she didn't do anything.Therefore, the equation is (75 - C - 15)(25 - C) = 0Michel was sorting apples. He sorted them by color. Then he sorted the apples by level, sorted by yellow, then by red. Dire screeching started by a red apple.
