 There were 743 people on the first ship.There are enough apples such that each person feeds on either an apple or a mouthful of water. Then if S is the number of people, put r = AP. There were an AP apples.Therefore, there were 27S apples.Say z is the number on each ship so that each row contains z people.The number of apples on each ship would be 27z.Therefore, if there were z ships, there would be 27z apples.How many apples does the monster eat in the first hundred years?answer: There were 743 people in the first ship.Then, for the next ship, there were (43/4) + 26 = ((743/4) + 28) (#

 Let A be the same as B, the number of people in the ship the monster consumed in the first hundred years.Then A^300 = 8, followed by A^2 = 4, followed by A^2 * A = 16.After the second hundred years, A = 2A ^ 2A = 2A * 2A = 16 * 16 = 256.Therefore, the number of people consumed in the second hundred years is 2*16*256 = 4096 people.The answer is 4096.question: One team ran#

 Let n be the number of humans.Then 0 < n < 847The first hundred years were n + 1 hundred yearsThus n = 847 - (177 - 100) = 466For the second hundred years:n = 847 - (1 + (996 - 100) = 533Now, the third hundred year is n = 847 - (3 + (441 - 100) = 468Therefore, out of 847, 467 people were eaten in the first three hundred years of the ship's existence. The number of people was equal to the number of people on the ship in a given year. The average was equal to the number in two-thirds of consecutive years with the 111th year excluded. answer = 467 / 1000 = 0.46. question#

 Let x be the number of people. x = 847 total x times = 847 * 100 = 84,000 per year x times = 284,500 each year x times = 53,250 when first eaten Let V be the number of ships on the river and let M be the number of people on those ships. Then, V / M = 2. x = 2V / M = 840 / 25,000 = 3.5 this is the ratio number of ships / people so V = 3.5M = 120 shipsSo, the number of people that could be on that ship in the first 100 years = 840 : 1200 = 7.5 that is the creatures ate 7.5 each hundred years, that is how many people there were#

 Let R be the number of people on the ship in the first 100 years.Then R = 847 * 100/100 = 47.The answer R = 47.question: A garbage truck was competing at a race in New York for prizes. The#

 Let A be the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.  Then A is 2 x 107 = 2,400,000.Let x be the number of times that the monster ate new ships. So The first time the monster came up the century was 100 years before this point. Now, x + 100 is 200, so the number of times that it came up was 2x = 200.Therefore, the number of people on the ship in the first hundred years was 200 divided by 10,000. That equals 20,000 people.Thus, the number of people on the ship was A + 2,200,000 divided by 10,000 = 20,000.The answer is 20,000.question:#

 The average number of people on the ship was 857/(100 x 100) = 10.5.Now we can use the formula: number of people = constant + average number of people per build multiplied by n number of buildso the number of people is: 842 + 10.5 x 17 = 1852 people.The answer is 1852.question: Steven had $20. He gave $5 to his sister Jerry, and $5 to his friend Kevin. The remaining money was $3 and $13, respectively.#

 Write # of people on each ship each year over 30 * 100 = 30 * 300 people = 300 people.Add year over 30 = 300 people. Therefore the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the first 100 years if the first 200 people and the second 300 people were on the same ship.The answer is 300 x 300.In the full story, the monster ate between the first and second 300 people. Therefore the number of people on the ship before the monster ate them is#

 Let S be the ship which the monster ate in the first hundred years and K be the number of people on it.So, S = 847 and K = 847.Note the constants are-ed and do not mix.Then, bK = K2 - K = K * (47 / 100) = S * 47/100 = 963.Multiply S times the 1000's.Thus, the number of people who were on S would be 963 * 47/100 = 947 people.So the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is 947.The answer is 947.question: If the weekly probability that a runner will win a Gold medal at a race is 3.33%, show that the expected number of gold med#

 Let x be the number of people on the ship.Let y be the number of boats.Let t be the number of years.It was a new ship in the first year.Therefore, t = 1.Let a be the number of people on the ship in the second year and the monster does not have to shoot it.Therefore, a = 1.It has likely shot a number from 1 to B previous to the starting point, so it is going to shoot at least one.Therefore, B > 1.It ate one person in the second and third and fourth years.Therefore, t = 3.And it ate x + 5 + 9 = 28 people.Therefore, x = 28.The answer is 28.question: Like#

 Because the monster reappeared after 100 years, it is a periodic function with period 100. Thus, to solve see if we can rewrite it as 3x + y = 0.If we do this, the Y value is 53 - 0 = 47 and so the number of people on that ship is 847 - 47 = 520.The answer is 520.question: Hassan recently lost 38 kg. He gained 22 kg in three months and lost 10 kg in two months.  How much did Hassan gain overall#

 Given the number of total people, 147 + 234 + 347, divide by 3, producing 743 / 300 = 230.The number of people on the first ship was 7: 147 / 11 = 234.The number of people on the second ship was 7: 234 / 2 = 347.Thus, the answer is 743 / 2 = 230.</s>#

 Let x be the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first warm ninety years.So, the first warm ninety years have exactly 92 pessoas on the ship.The first 100 years had 102 people on the ship, so there would be 102 - 92 = 8 more people in that century.And that would be 82 people on the ship for the hundredth year.Let y be the sum of the years.100 + 90 + 82 = 300.Distribute 30 to x so it becomes 90x + x/90 = 82.The term x/90 equals 4.To solve for x, we have 82/30 = 4.Therefore, there were 4 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.The answer#

 Let x be the number of people on the ship that the monster ate.Then 856 - x = 847.You first had to multiply the number of people by the total number of people in one hundred years.Then the number of deep-sea monsters grew by 1 in each hundred years.And the number of people in one hundred years is 100 * 100 * 100 = 103,000.And x is the number of people who ate one of the 100 monsters.Therefore, the number of people who ate one of the 100 monsters in the last hundred years was (100 * 100 * 100 * 100 * x)/100 = (100 * 106 * 103,000 * x)/100 = x.plus 1 = x+1.Although#

 Let N be the number of people killed. So N = 847.Then the difference, 882 - 847 = 100.So the desired ratio is 100/100 of 300 = 3%.So we find that 10 is the answer to the problem. As#
