 Let x be the number earned in the main job.Then the second job will earn, 20/30 = 0.50 less.Thus, x = 25.Then, the total number of hours worked is 30*0.50 + 25 hours.Therefore, the earnings are 20x + 75x + 25 or 120.The answer is 120.question: Maria bought one black and one white sweater for making a pair. Until now, she made 2 pairs of sweaters which have 3 different sizes#

 Let y be the amount of pay money per week.  We have y = 20 - 680/(60 * 2) = (40 * 2)/10 = (160 * 2)/5 = 360 * 2/6 = 480 * 2 = 720 (Cos = 40 * 2/6 - 480*2/6 = 240 * 2/9)Thus, 240, or four vingten, is the reasoning answer.The reasoning of this question is by easy conversion and detracting.question: In this situation, what#

 As he works 30 hours at his main job, he earns 120 hours *$20/hour = $2,000.Turning the constant 20 into hours produces 20/30 =.6. So his average hourly rate is.6 * $20/hour = $6, after all.Summing his two salaries, we have 2,000 + 6,000 = $12,000 per week.Correct answer is $12,000 per week.</s>#

 $(20 * (30 / 2)) / 7.1/2Therefore, James earns 20 + (20 * (30 / 2)) / 7.1/2 = (80 * (30 / 7)) / 6.25 = 375$5.75.  The answer is $375.question: Allen found a money collection box at a hazardous waste site.  On the cover was a picture of a lady with her legs up - naked.  There was a dollar coin in the hole.  He managed to get#

 Let B be the amount of money he makes at his second job.  Then B = 20 hours x (20 - 20)/60 = 9/4 = 2.6 times the money he makes at his first job.Let A be the amount of money he makes at his first job.  Then 40 + B - A = 30 + 2.6 - A = 15.We only need to find the difference B -A.B = 20 - A = 10.Because B is negative, we can change order of the difference so it's B - A = 10 - 2.6 = 8.Let A be the amount of money he makes at his first job.Then 20 - B = A.Taking the difference B -A gives 20 - A = A#

 The first part of the question is easy.  Wy theylo.  This means that he earns 30 hours*2 = 60 hours*5. Do$idogos that is 240 hours*20 hour$ per week.  The notation on the sheet makes me think it says he earns 20 hour$ a week.  That is wrong though. So, the answer is 240 hours*0.2 hour$.question: The number of bookmarks in a library is 150.

 Let W be the amount he earns per week.  Then let T be the total number of hours he's worked (30).  Let H be how many hours he worked at his main job (20).  The answer is W = T * (20 / 30) = ($2000 / $3000) * 10 = $100.000.question: Andronia will be driving her sister's car. Her car is 23 years old and she doesn't own a car warrant. She bought her sister a $20#

 Let x be the number of hours that James works at his main job.  And let y be the number of hours that he works at the second job.  Let z be the earnings Jim made per hour from both jobs: Then, the total earnings over a fortnight can be written as z x. Since James is working 30 hours at the main job this means that the total earnings from the second job would be z x / 30 = 5.5 y. The answer is 5.5 y.#

 Let x be the number of hours that James works at his main job.Then 30x hours are his first and second jobs.  Adding the values gives x1+30x2 = 90.so the value of the first job is x1+30x2 = 90.Standard life-cycle model says that the value of your second job is 60 percent of the value of your first job. Therefore, the value of his second job is 30 x 60/100 = 20 hours. Let U be the value of his first job. Then U = 20 hours.Therefore, his total weekly income would be U + 20 x 12 = 280.The answer is 280.question: Eleven apples were stolen at a fair that sets the price per apple at $5, and#

Let X be the number of hours James works at his main job.  Let 1/10 be the number of hours that he works at his second job.Then, salariales are X * 20/1 + 20/1 X * 1/10Summary : X + X - 20 = 1 That means X = 21.Then, the starting (non net) salary would be (20 + 1) * 21 = 423.5The net total salary would be 423.5 * 0.8 = 301.6Answer: James earns 220, or 301.6 per week.question: Merrihue worked at the vet school for 90 minutes. Anna worked there for 90 minutes. If Merrihue worked at her main job for 45 minutes, how#

 Let W be the total number of hours worked, W = 30 working days plus half the working days of his second job. So, W = 30 + 30 / 4 = 60. Let E be the total earnings, E = W x (20 4000 ) = 304000.  Then E / 60 = 120 per hour. Divide the work of 30 hours plus the work of the second job by 2 and get 12 working days. The work efficiency is W /(60 + 2 ) = 720 / 315 = 97.</s>INTRODUCTION

 So, if we let, x be the total number of hours James works, then x = 30.Then the value of x was divided by 30 which we interpreted as an hourly rate.  45 divided by x is an hourly rate of $19.67($19.67 x 60 - 23.33 = $19.67).This admittedly somewhat counter intuitive answer seems to hold up under close examination.question: Linsey had 100 apples and 20 oranges.  She likes apples#

 Let M be the time working at his main job and S the time working at his second job.The sum of times is M + S which is 40 hours.Then, he earned M * $20 per hour = $4,000 in his main job. Plus, he earned S * ($20 - 20%) = $700 per hour in his second job.So he earned $4,950 per week.The answer is 4,950.You can solve the equation for x = 7, and#

 Let x be the hours worked.Since James works 30 hr, then his wage is x * 20. Concatenate that with half of that many hours of work = 60 hours x $10. Therefore he makes x * 10 + 60 * 10 = $4,000 a week.question: One of Sally's fingertips is cut by digging in too deep.  She puts iodine on the cut finger and it cures.

 Let E be the goods earned per week and F be the goods earned per hour. Therefore, E*30 = E*(30 / 7) = F Since James earned 20 dollars an hour in hours worked at his main job and 5 dollars an hour in hours worked at his second job.  Thus, E = 20+10 = 35.Since there are 350 days in a week, E*350 = E*(35/7) = F. Therefore, F = 50.(20+35) = F = 50. The answer is 50.question: How many bucks is Cindy’s change?
