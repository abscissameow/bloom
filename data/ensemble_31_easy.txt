 Let X be the number of paintings sold by Noah. Let Y be the  number of paintings a large painting is worth. Let Z be the number of a small painting is worth. Then the total sales of paintings is X + Y + Z.Let P be the number of large or small paintings sold by Noah. Let  be the number of large paintings that a person is willing to pay. Let easy  be another constant number. Then  = P - X.So the last equation can be simplified to  = easy  And  = P - X.To solve this equation for x, we have x = 1.5 P.Therefore, either 1 or 1.5 paintings are large paintings.And the equation is easy = 1#

 Let x = A be the number of small paintings sold.Then, x + 4 = 8.Combining INCLUDES simplifies this to 2x = 8.So we have: 2x = 10.
The value of x is 10.The answer is 10.question: Midacke packs 15 boxes of rice and resorts to folding over the bottom to get some space. Mild inflation was 0.066 in percent. Then he stacked the packets and packed them without folding. At the beginning of#

 Let N be the number of large paintings and S be the number of small paintings.Then N + S = 8.Let U be the number of paintings sold this monthWe have 8 x 59/100 + 4 x 30/100 = U.Let Y = U (N + S).We have Y = 8 x 59 + 4 x 30 = 162.Therefore, the sales for Noah during this month is U = 8 x 59 + 4 x 30 = 162.The formula for equation of this sort is U = (N + S) & 1/2 & U/2.Thus the exact sales is (8 + 4) x 59 /100 & (59 /10) /2 & (59 /10) /4 = 162 / (32 * 2/ (10 * 4 )).The result is United States dollars.i  This line is the square bracket at the end of the equation. If U is in millions, the result is multiplied by 10^n i  This line takes care of the fractions#

 Let's write x = the number of large paintings sold.Then, let y = the number of small paintings sold. Then 8 * x + 4 * y = x + y.Letting y = 2 * x yields 2 * x = 4 * y.Thus we should write 8 * x + 4 * 2x = x + 2x.Letting x = 1 and y = 2 yields 8 * x + 4 * 2 = 4x2. factoring this expression yields 4 = (8 * 2) * x + 4, or 8 * (2 * x). If you multiply both sides of this equation by 8, you get (8 * 2) * x + 4 = x + x. Likewise (8 * 2) * (2 * x) = 8 * (2 * x) = x + x. Thus 8 = 4 * (2 * x) + 4. It seems strange that 4 * (2 * x) would be the same thing as 8 * x +#

 Let T be the number of paintings sold this month.So, T = 2*8 = 16.Therefore, Noah's sales were 16 x $30 = $360.The answer is $360.We are going to repeat the above step to continue solving#

 Let Y be the number of large paintings, and X be the number of small paintings. Then 8 * 60 = 480 and 4 * 30 = 120.So he would have sold 2 * 480 + 2 * 120 = 540 small paintings.So the expression reduces to 2 * 360 + 2 * 120 = 920.Subtract 760 from it, for the change, and this reduces to 240.Therefore, the number of profitable paintings sold by Noah is 900 - 240 = 720.The answer is 720.question: Alice, Brown and Red had 6 apples and ate all of them. Janice, Brown and Blue had 5 apples and ate 2 of them. Janice, Red and Black had 2 apples. How many total apples were eaten by everyone#

 Let x be the number of large paintings that Noah sold.Then the number of small paintings sold would be 20x.Then the sum of all the paintings would be 28 + 20x = 56.Thus, the expression simplifies to 28 + 28 x 20 = 56.To solve for x, we have 56/28 = 3.Therefore, he sold 3 large paintings and 27 small paintings.The answer is 27.</s>#

 So, he only had four large paintings.This was the total change from his pot.And there are (8 + 4) paintings in total.Therefore, the new display had more than the amount of change.And we have (8 ^ 2) - (4 * 8) = (8 x 4) = 204.Taking new taxes, we have 8 x 4 + 8 x 4 = 443.Therefore, Noah's sales for this month is 443 - (80 + 30) = 333.And the answer is 333.question: Mike and Sally are designing a Beckwith sink. They use 25% marble and 75% porcelain in the sink to achieve impromax. If there are small mismatches in marble and porcelain, what#

 Let x be the number of handmade paintings. Then, there are (x + 1) large paintings.So, his original sales were 8 large paintings * (60/30) x (30/8) = 180.Then he sold eight + four = 10 large paintings thus his sales increased by 60/30 x (10/8) = 80.Then let x = (180 + 80) = 90.Since the sales were at least 90, the answer is 90.The answer is 30.question#

 Let C be the number of larger paintings sold this month.Let B be the number of smaller paintings sold this month.Then 8 * (60/30) = 4*2 = 8.For all the larger paintings sold, subtract the smaller ones sold:8 - 8 = 0.For all the sanger paintings sold, again subtract smaller ones sold, making it 8 * (60/30) = 4 (again).Then 8 * (1/9) = 2 * 6 = 12.Using the product rule, multiply by a left hand side barca(I'd switch the member b with a right hand side): 8 * (1/9) = 2 * 1 * 6= 12.Easy- I just use 12 times the price of the smaller painting:#

 Let p be the price of the large painting.Let m be the number of large paintings bought.Then there are (p * m) bought paintings.Then, lets write the formula for selling as (p-m)*2*m.Then, we solve for m and get -78/8 = 52.m =. Thus, the sales for the month was 698.5 *.5/27 = 1485.5. The answer is 1485.5.question: 40 pairs of#

 Let T be the sales revenue for this month. Then the sales revenue for last month would be 8 * $30 = 240.Then in order to have the same sales revenue, he would have sold 240*2 = 480 paintings. Thus, his sales for this month would be 8 * $30 * 2 = 960 paintings.The answer is 960.And because his median price is $60, his arithmetic mean is 60 * 480 / 960 = 84.40.Therefore, his average price would be 84.#

 Let A be the shopping total for last month.Then, let B be the total sales for this month. Then A + DB = 8 bigs + 4 smalls thus, A + DB = 15 larger-pic + 9 smalls. kepemimpinan information: menguasai.

 Noah sold 8 large paintings twice, so the 12 sold paintings would count as two paintings each.Then he sold 4 small paintings, so 4 small paintings would count as one painting each. Raheel sold 4 paintings, so 4 paintings would count as one painting each.Hence importantly, Noah sold four large paintings and eight small paintings so the 12 sold paintings would count as two paintings each.Then he sold four small paintings, so 4 small paintings would count as one painting each.So, the number of paintings sold this month would be two large paintings and 10 small paintings.The total sales for this month would be 2 * 60 + 10 * 30 = 500.The answer is 500.question: Judy estimate the crying time of softballs station#

 Let x be the number of large paintings sold last month. Then x * 60 = 0.8 x 10 = 80.So Noah sold 8 large paintings for 80 bucks.And then he sold 4 small paintings for 30 bucks. So to convert the millions to dollars, we multiply the units by 1000 to get 0.8x = 8 * 1000 = 8000.And then we add 8000 to (0.8x - 8) = 4000.Then we divide the two numbers by 4.Because there are only two values that come out, the graph shows us this data points.
