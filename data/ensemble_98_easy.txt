 Hector purchased a container of gumballs as 6 - 2 - 5 = 1.9.Seeing that Alisha wanted 1.7 and Todd wanted 3, Hector gave them all to Todd so the total amount of gumballs that he had bought was 2.1Less than twice as many as he had given to Alisha so the amount that he gave Todd was 2/2.1 = 1.1 times as much as she wanted. Therefore, Hector gave 3.9 times as many to Bobby as he had given to Todd so 4B = 1.9Textile And Material比较多，零售跟批发比较好。考得也比较早就考这个。主要是对这个方面的概念、业务流程和采购的相关知识点，以及一些简单的计算。from:孙金峰的tel:3372308220</s>#

 Let x be the number of gumballs purchased by Hector.Then x + 4 = 26.Let ax be the number Hector gave to Todd.Let x be the number Hector gave to Alisha.Then 2*x - 5*x = 11.Derive ax/x, substituting.The answer is x = 4/5 = 1.Therefore, Hector purchased 26 + 4 + 5 = 29 gumballs.The answer is 29.question: A penalty was 4 times more on Friday than on#

 Let Y, X, Z refer to numbers Hector gave to each of the other Games Y = the number of gumballs Hector gave to Todd Z = the number of gumballs Hector gave to Bobby Then (Y + Z - Y - Z) = (4 * 2) - 5 * ((4 + 1) - 3) = (4 * 2) - 5 * 3 - (4 + 1) - 3 = 9 Hence, the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased is And the answer is 9.question: The dog Martha ate 1/9 of Keith's collection of baseball cards. The gummi perishables sold out before all the cards in Keith's collection of baseball cards was eaten. How many cards will there#

 Let H be the number of gumballs Hector purchased. Then, we have 36 = H - 4.Combining the equations, we have, H and 2H are the same.Thus, H = 2 and H = 8.Every time Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd, he gave twice as many to Alisha.Thus, he gave 4 * 2 = 8 gumballs twice as many times as he gave to Bobby in total.The sum of H and 2H is 26 so the result is H = 8 and H = 26.Therefore, the difference is and overall, Hector purchased 6 + 6 = 12 gumballs in total.The answer is 12.question: On Monday, Ernie logged 48 hours.#

 Here, let x be the number gumballs Hector purchased.Let A be the number of gumballs that he gave to Alisha.  Then let C be the number of gumballs that Hector gave to Todd on the first day.  Then let B represent the sum of the gumballs that he gave on the second and third days. Then let 5 represent the gumballs that Hector had left in the container at the beginning of the fourth day and let 4 be the number of gumballs that he used to give to Todd on the fourth day.  Suppose he used x gumballs to give to Todd on the first day, y gumballs on the second and third days and 4 gumballs to give to Todd on#

 To begin, let VA be the number of gumballs that Alisha received, VB be the number of gumballs that Todd received, VC be the number of gumballs that Hector received, and V = VA + VB + VC.  Then VA = 4, VB = 6, VC = 5.  Also let EI = 4, or the number of times he gave, then IA = 4, IB = 6, ID = 1, where I = I + AI + IB + ID.  Then A = IA + IB, B = 1 + 2A, C = 3A in the constant on the right.  Therefore, Equation 1 becomes 12%A + 48%B + 41%C = 4.  Let q be the portion divided among the two boys, then q = 70% - 20%(4/3) = 2/2.  Therefore, the answer is 2.Several questions of the form "The number of apples that X gained from Y is the same as the number of apples that Z lost from W#

 Let a be the number of gumballs that Hector gave to Todd.Then a + b = 6.Obviously, a + 4 = 6.And a + b < 4.So a + b = 3.Let c be the number of gumballs that Hector gave Alisha.Then a -c = c.So a - 4 = 3.And a - b = 3.Let d be the number of gumballs that Hector gained by giving 5 times what he had given to Alisha.  Then 5 x d = b.  So a - 5 = d.  With help solving quadratic equations, we discover that d = 6 - B + B.We know that 56 = 6 - 5 + 5. Therefore, 6 - 5 = 9.So B = 6 - 9 + 9.Because 6 = a + b + c + d, we know that a + b + c + d is 12.So the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased is 12.#

 Let m be the number of gumballs that Hector gave to Todd initially.Then, 2m + 5 = 8 gumballs was all that remained.The number of gumballs given to Todd is m。Identify the constants. पन्नtsPerdonne s Passepretty balance not particularly well You need to deduct 100 today Pissing on flowers eating off showcase The treasurer has persuaded you to calculate the work you are owed at the end of the semester Even if you walk to the bus stop You were peegetName what it doesn't need And cite it and reply What's dentist ra-A really helpful in the oddest way you may guess Ergo intake of Detail's that can solve 'needwant Even if there is no one#

 Each gumball is 1/100th of a dollar so the total cost is 19 gumballs.  Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd so he gave 0.4 * 19 = 6 gumballs to Todd. Then, Hector gave twice as many as he had given to Todd to Alisha so he gave 1.4 * 19 = 3½ gumballs to Alisha. And then, Hector gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha so he gave 0.8 * 19 = 4 gumballs to Bobby.Since he gave 4 gumballs to Todd and 3½ gumballs to Alisha, then he gave 4 - 3½ = 1 gumball to BobbyLet C be the number of gumballs Hector purchased.Then, Hector has 156 gumballs.  Hence, C = 156/4 = 36 gumballs.Let R be the number of gumballs he gave to Todd.Then, R =#

 Let t be the number of gumballs give to Alisha.Then t = (4 + 2*5) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 16.Summing t over the gumballs gives 39.Let a = 9 - 28 = 15.Then Hector purchased 27 gumballs.The answer is 27.question: Two friends played a game Barbies.  For each win, they both got one Barbie.  They each got a total of 5 Barbie's.  The friend who#

 In this equation, the left side is what he gave to Todd for 4 gumballs.  Because he gave 4, the value of x is 4.The value of y is twice 4 = 8.Then the value of z is four times 8 = 32.Then the remaining gumballs equals 32 - (65 - x - y) = 15.The left side is equal to the right side minus 15 gumballs so the solution to the equation is (3/5)(4/7) = 4.Therefore, he had 4 gumballs left.The answer is 4.question: Mike’s girlfriend Meg bought a dildo.  She tells. the store clerk, “ Just make it very happy and see if I like it!#

 Let x be the number of gumballs that Hector purchased.So A x = 0.Therefore, 0 A x = 86.Then 4x = 86.Therefore, Hector purchased 3 gumballs.answer: Students take a text from their library card on the first day of school.  The number of books they take is counted on the second day of school so their total is 12 12 4 = 48. So they each have a total of 48 textbooks.  The student with the yellow card has 48#

 Let A = the number of gumballs that Hector gave to Todd.Then Hector had A + twice as many as he gave to Alisha, giving him twice as many gumballs.Making this an equivalent expression to AB gives A = AB = A + B.Now A = 4 and B = 2 takes on the value 7.The answer is 7.</s>#

 if  gumballs had been collected at.4 speed, then hall would have 1.67 gumballs when he took 4 to Todd. Then he would have 2 gumballs when he took twice as many as he gave to Alisha. Then he would have 1.67- 1 -2 = 0.933 gumballs after giving 5 gumballs less than 4 times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha and the gumballs he removed. Therefore, hall had 6 -0.933 = 5.333 gumballs left when he returned. The answer is 5.333.question: If S men and 4 women read Blueberries for lunch, how many breads does each woman read?answer:#

 Let y be the number of gumballs that Hector gave to Alisha.  Then - 4 + 5*y = - 12 and 2*y = 12.So y = ( - 12 ) / ( 5 ) = - 50.Then y = ( - 12 ) / ( 98 ) = 0.  Therefore, y = 52.Thus, he had 52 gumballs when he bought the container.Let x be the number of gumballs that he gave to Todd.  Then 42 - 4*x = 94.  Thus x = ( - 12 ) / ( 98 ) = 3.  Therefore, he gave 3 times as many total gumballs to Todd as he had given to Alisha.The answer is 3.question: Annie gave 13 apples#
