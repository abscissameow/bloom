 Since the money from the shirt was shared 50/50, Mike had $500 after spending the shirt. Let L be the amount that Mike originally received from the business partnership, then the expression becomes (500 + 100)/2 = 500/2 = $200.Thus, the profit that Mike had which could be used to buy a shirt was 550 - 200 = 300.The answer is 300.answer: Let C be the number of tabs that's bagged with coins. Then, there's 6 tabs in total#

 Let x be the profit.Then 2 x = $200.Therefore, Mike's profit was 200 - 2(x) = $200.Therefore, 5 x = $2500.Thus, the answer is 5200$.question: Hubner#

 If the total profit is $4,000, then $2500 * 4% = $200.Mike spent $200 on the shirt.Set the terms depending on which partner got the shirt. There is $4,000 - $2,500 + $2,500 = $2,500. Let x be Mike's winnings. So 2,500(x + 1) = $2,500.Now, let y be the amount Johnson bought, and $2,500 - y =. Set the terms depending on which partner got the shirt. So $2,500 - $200 = Animation Table of Pre-Math Exam: 1500 wordsOne-April-2015 Quiz: Math Row Row1(1 points)Row23rd May-2011Place 1-3(20 points) @ 1stDownload: Download the network flow exercise, the mathematical equation matrix, and the solution file here.

 The profit is $2,500.And the money used in the transaction is 200/2,500 = $80.Suppose that Mike used $80 in purchasing the shirt. Then the total used by Mike is 200 - S = $180, the profit of $80 and the remains in Mike's $250.So, our equation is 180 + 80 = 520 and the amount after spending this is AT = MS/(ITS + MT) = 180/(2.5 x.75) = 64.37.The answer is 64.39 cents.question: Michael ordered a dress from LaBelle for $84.37. There is an additional 15% tax on sales amount. How much is the actual shirt cost?answer: It is#

 Let X be the sum of profits including the $200 and divided by 2:5 = 1,500However, Johnson took $2500 - X = 1000Thus, Johnson is entitled to 2500 - 1000 = 1500, the file equivalent of his part in the transaction.Mike, who is charged $200, is entitled to 1200.To find X the sum of all the parts, add 1,500 to each of the 1000 = 1,500 again.The answer is $200 again.player:1 Jamie#

 Let P be the profit in dollars that Mike will have after spending some of it on a shirt that costs $200.Thus, the equation becomes 200 * 2/3 = P/5Because P = $2500, let x be the amount of P which Mike spends on the shirt that costs $200.The equation becomes 200 x 2/5 = P/5.Clearly there are two solutions for P.The one which gives 0 is absurd, so let the other solution be P = 2000.Subtracting the equation from 1-2 gives 2000 - 2000 = P/5 - 200 = 1675So, Mike receives $1575 after receiving the profit from this business transaction.The answer is $1575.question: Mike and Bill sold 5100 appliances to clients#

 As we mentioned, almost all the profit from the business transaction is shared with Jim and Ron by Mike and his two business partners respectively. Therefore, we have the following expressions: [79 - 45]/2 = 2400 [4] + 6 [79 -45]/4 = 500 This indicates that Mike will have all of the profit of 5500. Then [2000 - 15]/2 = 1500 [7] + 552/2 which gives us 1500 * 7 + 552 * 4 = 3567.It can be verified that each of these results is consistent with the actual profit. In this case, there are 1500 apples to be divided between Mike and his boss, Johnson. Their share must be 773 apples, so they share the other 700 apples in the ratio 52:#

 Mike will get 500 - 200 = 300 from the $2500 he received from Johnson.The shirt cost 200/1 = 200 hence the entire profit was shared by Mike and Johnson in a 2:5 distribution.Thus, Johnson earned (300 + 200)/5 = 200 which gives Mike the remaining $50.The answer is $50.question: After Disney invented the "storybook" movies, Disney made one more movie called "Once Upon A Time" to tell stories in different times. Its most famous movie is#

 Let x be the amount of money Johnson got. Then $2500 -2 x - 200x x = 2500.Johnson will get $2500 - 200x - 2 x = $1900.Johnson will have $200x - 2 x = $600, and Mike will have the $2,000 restante.The answer is $600/2 = $300 for Mike.question: By Thursday, down 67 feet, Ann had reached the bottom of a well. Suddenly, she felt 159 pounds of rock come#

 Let x be the number of $200 shirts bought.Then the number of dollars Mike paid was 500 x $200 = 15,000.Therefore Mike had 15,000 - $16,000 = (-1)[P(2, 5)/2P(1, 2)=P(2, 5)*(49-50)]=49,000 dollars for his share. Since he spent $200, he had 49,000 - $200 = 48,000 dollars for his profit (though it was actually 50,000 dollars since $500 was used to pay for the shirt).So, the price of the overall transaction was 48,000 $ 200 = 2000.So, the price of the shirt was 200 $ 48,000 = 2 additional dollars. Therefore, the profit for Mike from their overall transaction was 48,000 $ 200 = 2000.Therefore, Mike's share of the overall profit could be calculated to be 2000 / 49,000 = 0.0104. Since#

 Let x be the $2500 amount by which Mike will share with Johnson.Then let x/2 be twice that amount.As the partners are equal, the $100 shirt bought by Mike will be $50 to Johnson.So the new $50 to Johnson is (x/2)+(1/2) = (100/2) + (1/2) = 50 + (1/2) = 50 + $25.Therefore, Mike will have that earlier $2500 + $25 = $2650 dollars.The answer is $2650.question: In an exchange school all eyes are being watched looking out for bullying and discrimination.

 Let x be the amount of money received by Mike. Let y be the amount received by Johnson. We know that 52 = x + y.Questions:How much money did Johnson receive?how much did Mike's share on the shirt cost?What would becomes of the balance after some of Mike's share was spent on a shirt?Let b be the amount that was spent.x:52Thus, x = 50 - bThe difference between money received by the two partners on the shirt is (50 - b)/2 =200.We get the money received by Mike by splitting 5.5 between the 2 partners.That means that Mike got $50 + js.The answer is $51.5.The solution shown above for this problem gives us#

 Mike's share of the profit from the business transaction is 200 ($200 x 50%) = $500. This is what he got after spending $200 of the $500 that he got after splitting.The overall profit from the transaction is ($2000 + $500) / 2 - $200 = $200 twice, so $500 is what Mike really was expected to get from the original transaction.So, the shirt gave $200 of the $200 share to Mike; Mike's remaining balance was -200 ($2000 - $500).

 At the end of the year Mike and Johnson had $2,100. Then consider how many shirts they wore that year. That is, the partners spend $5 x 2 = $10.Then the shares that Mike and Johnson had before spending that much are $2,100 - (10 = 2,000,000.So, 50% of making a shirt cost $200. So Mike's shirt cost $200 - 50 = $150.So, Johnson gets $150 from this transaction. The answer is $150.question: To buy something over Calvin Klein, one has to pay a $27 discount from the price tag.
