 The first two terms are the same so there is always 11 X 8= 168.And the last two terms add up to zero. This means each term must add to or equal the first two.And this is the case when X = 13 X 9= 312The final term becomes 10-12 would then be 343How many stamps did Bella buy in all?answer: Bella bought 12 X 14 = 168 snowflake stamps, 9 X 13 = 106 truck stamps, and 13 X 2 = 26 rose stamps in all.The answer is 312 + 168 + 26 = 501.Question 46.Who is the fourth pastor in the New Testament?Answer: John A 4 x 36 = 176.</s>#

 Let, x, be the number of rose stamps that she bought. Then 9 + 13 - 11 = x.9 + 13 - x - 11 = 36 - x = 11.Therefore, the number of rose stamps that she bought was (11 + x) = (11 + 36 - x) = x = 9.The answer is 9.question: Betsy has 39 pennies. She has to buy 20 pennies sweets and 15 pennies yellow#

 Let x be the number of snowflake stamps Bella bought.Then 9 + 11 - x = 12.So x = 12.And the total number of facebook stamps Bella bought is (12 + 9 + 13) = 42.The answer is 42.question: Steven bought 4 tomato cans from a store. Billy bought 1 more tomato can than Steven. He bought 2 more milk cans than Tom. Let B be the number of milk cans. Then 4 - B - 1 = 3#

 Let x be the number of snowflake stamps, then x = 11.Then, we have to count 9 + 13 - x = 28 more stamps than snowflake stamps.Thus, the equation becomes 9 + (8-x) + 13 - (x - 8) = 28.Writing 8 as 8 *(-1) and adding the negative both sides, we can solve as 9 + (8 * (-1)) + (8 * -1) + 13 - x = 28.Combining the like terms, 8*(-1) + 8 * -1 + 13 - x = 1, 2x(-1) = 8, 12 - x = 24, and 8x (-1) + 8 * -1 + 13 - 24 = -1.Variable x simplifies as if we add two terms with the same value we have two terms with same value. Thus the expression becomes 9 + (8 * (-1)) (8 * -1 + 1) - 24 = 10 - 24#

 Let B be the stamps that had a snowflake design.Then 11 + 9 = 20 of the stamps had a snowflake design.Thus, 20 + 13 = 33 were not snowflake stamps.The number she bought in all was 11 + 20 + 13 = 45 stamps.Therefore, 51 stocks had a truck design.The outcome is 45 / 2 = 21 stamps.Therefore the number of stamps she bought with a truck design was 21 (45 - 11 - 13).The total number of stamps she bought was 21 + 32 = 51 stocks. Let C be the number of stamps that had a rose design.The number she bought was 21 + 32 + C = 110 stamps. Because#

 Let X be the number of truck stamps, Z be the number of snowflake stamps, Y be the number of rose stamps,  B be the number of all stamps, and T the total number.X - B = 9, and X + B = 11.Using this in the formula Y = B + X + (B - X)T = 11 + 9 + 26T = 55.Multiplying the two resulting equations.T-1 = 8, and T + 1 = 59.The next step is to subtract the first equation from the second and put the result as the final equation.Then you have Y = B + X - X$B = 11 - 8$2+ 27$$= 26.The result is 26, the answer is 26.question: Cara was sure that Jamal was going home for dinner.

 Let Y be the number of snowflake stamps.Then 66% of the stamps were truck stamps and 34% were snowflake stamps.So, Y = (66 - 33) * 11/12 = 54.Let x be the number of truck stamps.Then 71% of the stamps were snowflake stamps and 29% were snowflake stamps.So, x = (74 - 31) * 9/12 = 51.Thus, Y = 54 - 51 = 9.Let x be the number of rose stamps.Then 22% of the stamps were truck stamps and 78% were snowflake stamps.So, x = 7 * (22 - 7 + 78)/12 = 32.Therefore, Y = 9 - (32 + 1) = 4. Let X be the number of stamps Bella bought in all.Hence, Y = 11 - (4 * (10 - 12 + 1)) / 12 = 6.Thus#

 Let D be the number of rose stamps. 11 - D - 9 = 8.Combining constants produces 51 - D = 8.However in the cpulunch come to chqtim, math problem there we find D 26 + (-13) 21 = 8. Thus, the number of amazon truck stamps is 9.And the number of rose stamps is 10. The answer is 10.question: In 2012, Tassia bought 7418 Nike shoes shoes, and in#

 Let S be the total number of stamps that Bella bought.  S, 11 + 9 + 13 = 44.Adding S to both sides produces, (11 + 9 + 13) = 44.Adding S to both sides gives,.
( 11 + 9 ) + ( 13 - 1) = 44.After simplification, it becomes 11 + 9 - 13 = 10.It is perpendicular to the given triangle.Thus the area of the triangle with the given base is 2√3.The area of the base of the triangle is 1. therefore the area of the triangle is 2√3. karena ada siku pada sisi tidak baku, maka panjang insat idaya bangun ruang persegi sempurna adalah √3.The opposite angle of the right angled triangle is#

 Let S be the total number of stamps, and let SS, SP and SL be the sets of snowflake, rose, and truck stamps.So SS + SL + SP = S. Let x be the number of snowflake stamps. Then x + SS + SL + SP = 11 or 11x + SS + SL + SP = 11x + 11. Adding the three sets, and simplifying, gives 11 = SL + SP + SS - 11.Complex substitution produces 43 + 11x = 44 or 3x = SL - 11- SS - SP (simplify) = 3x - SS (simplify) - SP (simplify) from which we get 3 = SS (simplify) - SP (simplify) - 15. Subtracting 11x gives x = 36 and 2x = 19. Therefore, we have 18 = S - 13 - 36 - 19. Thus, the total number of stamps is 18 = S - 13 - 58.#

 The total number of stamps bought by Bella was 1+(11*9/10) = 20.To find out more about the stamps, use the following equation:To the left the number being added is x.9/10 to the right recognises the fact that every tenth stamp has a snowflake.And 13/10 to the right represents the number of rose stamp.Then, 1+10*9/10 = 15+Bulla buys 10x More than 10 That is, every tenth stamp has a snowflake stamps.· And 1+10*13/10 = 15+Bella buys 13 x More than 13 That is, every tenth stamp has a rose stampQuestions:# Question #Question #Question # rM i f Q C u#

 Let x be the number of all the snowflake stamps Bella bought.Then 11 x 41 % 102 = 61 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. And 11 x 41 - 61 = 10 rose stamps. Thus, the number of all the stamps Bella bought is x + 39 = 41.The answer is 41.question: In 1995 the spaghetti-making machine made 125 pounds of spaghetti.

 Let X be the actual number of all the stamps Bella bought.Let X be the number of snowflake stamps Bella bought Let X be the number of truck stamps Bella bought.Therefore, we have i=11 * 9-13 = 64-x.Then  x = 64 - 37 or 31stamps.But her total must be x + u, where i is the actual number stamps and u the number of stamps with a particular design.So by adding and subtracting, her total equals x * i + (x + u) * i = (71 - 38) * 9 + (31 - 37) * 11 + (63 - 31) * 13 = (11 * 53 - 11 * 18) + 49 = 397 or x = 11.Thus, the number of all the stamps that Bella bought is 11.The answer is 11.question:  The black shirt hated the day he was born.

 Let x be the number of snowflake stamps.Let y be the number of truck stamps.Then Let's compare 3x + 6y to 7.We'll see that 3 + 6 > 7.x + y = 11.The equation simplifies to 3x + 6y = 7x or (3y) - x = 7x or 2x + 6m = 7x where m = (3y) - (3x).We'll have 2x = 88 and 6m = 13.The number of snowflake stamp is x = 11.So the number of truck stamp is y = 88 - 11 = 83.Then e.g the number of rose stamp is m = 13 - 1 = 12.Therefore, the number of all stamps is = 11 + 83 + 12 = 129stamps.The answer is 129.question: A box holds 300 criminology books and 165 philosophy books.

 Let: Bbe the number of stamps that had both a snowflake and a truck design. Let: Bbe the number of stamps that had a snowflake only. Let: Bbe the number of stamps that had a truck only. Let: Rbe the number of stamps that had roses only. Then:BA + BR = 211. Let RB = 92. Let AR = 4.Let: AL = 21 Thus AB = 212.B + AL = 211.B - AR = 92.B - AB = 88.Let: A = 11. Let B = 45 Go 3 - 4 + 1 = 3 and cut 3 from B.Remove the 3 from BA, which appears above AR. Let the remaining be A. As you know, to subtract numbers, you must not cut off any part of the number you are trying to sub.So: BA = 12 - 12 = 2. BR = 9 - 22 = 7. RB = 2 -#
