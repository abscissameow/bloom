 Supposing we have two salting water transitions, our aquarium is A3z. Then the desired value of A in liters is XFC.The height is 3x + (z/2) so the result can be substituted into the width equation to find z: The height is 4x + (z/2) so the result can be substituted into the width equation to find z: The height of an aquarium is 11,3 L, the width is 74,4 L. The result is 68,58 L.The height is 11.3L so depth is 18 * 3 = 45 cm. The width is 74.4L so length is 117.4 * 4 = 392.44 cm. We forgot about the bottom, let us#

 The area of the aquarium is 4 x 6 - 3 = 30.The volume of water in the aquarium is 30 / 50 = 0.75 cubic feet of water.The answer is 3/4C.question: Ronnie is doing some tasks#

 Let A be the initial amount of water in the aquarium. The amount after she leaves remains the same 4 cubic feet. Also, the amount that she fills back is 3/4 times the initial amount so it's 1/4 by the definition of fraction.Thus the equation is 4/15 = 1/4.The answer is 1/4.question: Max and Billy were chasing after Jeff and Chris. Jeff lost 9/2 of his speed and Chris lost 5 of his speed. How much faster were they before they were chased#

 Let be the current amount of water in the aquarium.Then after Nancy adds more water to the aquarium, the new value would be: + 4 = Thus the 'natural' value of the amount of water currently in the aquarium is: 4.After the cat knocked the aquarium over, the new value would be: + 4 = Thus the 'natural' value of the amount of water currently in the aquarium is: 4.The value after the cat knocked the aquarium over is therefore give by: + 4 = 8.The volume of water in the aquarium is therefore: 8.The answer is 8.</s>#

 Let L be the length, W be the width, and H be the height of the aquarium. Then L * W * H = 4 * 6 * 3 = 18.But the volume is the product of the lengths multiplied by the widths multiplied by the heights. So V = 18.Then the volume is (4 * 3) * (6 * 3) = 36 cubic feet of water.The answer is 36 cubic feet.question: Paul is adding on a street sign accurately with#

 Let A be the total amount of water.Let B be the amount of water Lady has already put back in the aquarium which is half of A.Let C be the amount of water that spilled out of the aquarium which is equal to double the size of A.Let D be the amount of water she has filled the aquarium in.Therefore, we have:  A/(4 - 0) = C/Clearly the ratio of C to A is C/A = 4 - 0.1/3.0 which equals 2/2/3 or 2/5 since that is the ratio of 3/5.Therefore, we have:   3/5*(4 - 0) = 2/5.C/(2/5.4 - 0) =   (3/5*(4 - 0))/(2/5.4 - 0) =   (3/5*(4 - 0))/(4 - 0) =   (3/5) - (1/5) = 1/5.D/2#

 Let L be the length of the aquarium.The aquarium is 4 * (L - thr) / 2.Now thr is the height of the aquarium.Therefore, the volume of water in the aquarium is (4*(L- thr)/2) + (3*thr)/6Archimedes figured out the side of a solid "triangle-shaped" (or "flower-shaped" or "ram's horn") with a length of goma equal to 30!!! By hypothetizing, as he did in this scene, that this "goma" was an iron metal, what did he construct, as opposed to judging by projectile motion, to have a force of U equal to GA, where U is#

 Let A be the amount of water in the aquarium. Then A = (6/3) x 4 x 3 = 72.Then putting 72 into the equation gives A = 32/1.Then since 3/2 = 2 and 6 1/3 = 7, we have 32/1 = 2 + 1/2 + 7 = 29.The answer is 29 cubic feet.question: The butterfly and the flower were in my necklace. I cut off the butterfly and only left the flower. I made spokes out of#

 Let A be the size of the aquarium. Then: 0, 2 = 2.Let X be the amount of water that Nancy poured into the aquarium. Then: 1, 1 = 2.Let Y be the amount of water that the cat knocked into the aquarium. Let Z be the amount of water that fell out of the aquarium. Then: 3, 3 = 6.Let u be the amount the water in the aquarium. Then: 3, 0 = 3.Let v be the amount the cat knocked into the aquarium. Then: 3, 2 = 6.Let w be the amount of water that went out of the aquarium. Then: 3, 3 = 6.Then, u + v + w = A.x + y + z = A.3x + 6 + 3 = A.x + 2 = A.x + 2.Let X be the amount of water lost. Then: 0, 0 = A.Let Y be#

 Let x be the number of cubic feet of water in the aquarium.Let y be the length of the aquarium.Then the number of cubic inches per meters are x = 4/3 x 6 = 6x.So each meter of aquarium is 6 cubic feet.Let z be the width of the aquarium.Then the number of cubic inches per meters are 3 x 4/3 x 6 = 24 cubic feet.Each meter of aquarium is 0.24 cubic feet in width and width plus height is 6 cubic feet.Thus, the number of cubic feet of water in each square meter of aquarium is 0.24 + 6 = 9.8.Let r be the height of the aquarium.Then the number of cubic feet#

 Let A be the height of the aquarium.Then A = (4 -6) x 3 = 1 36 inches.Let B be the width of the aquarium.Then B = (6 -3) x 3 = 5 12 inches.$1 36 = 1/36 = 26 294 144 cubic feet.$B=5/12=0.5851 million cubic feet.Intermediate steps for the expansion are $2094144$ or $5.051 million feet, $209414400$ or $52 million cubic feet, and $259053600$ or $50.8 million cub input field is, or was, controlled by a computer, then do the following steps to find the price.for $0.50, find the quarter or -round the quarter down#

 We now have a formula to find the amount of water in the aquarium. Let a and b be the length and width of the aquarium. Next, we scale these values along the direction of height.Therefore, the aquarium is ³ a x b² = ³ 120 x 80.26 = 24.5.So, Nancy's aquarium is 3.375 x 2.2 x 1.4 = 196 cubic feet.The answer is 196 cubic feet.question: Sally#

 Let H be the total height.Then the width is 6H = 24.And the aquarium is 4H = 12 inches long. Therefore, we have 8H = 36 inches total in the aquarium.Transferring the 12 inches to the height gives us a total height of 8H = 36 inches. Since the aquarium is 3H = 9 inches high, 3 = 4/9.Thus, we have 36 inches = 4/9 inches = 0.09 meters.Therefore, the volume of the aquarium is 36 meters.The answer is 36 meters.question: A boat is traveling at normal speed. Given the forest in front of the boat, the boat must be passed through the forest (assuming the forest to be linear like a#

 Let x be the number of cubic feet of water.Then 46x = 4.62.Thus, the number of cubic feet is x = 4.62= 3.891.Therefore, the answer is 3.891 cubic feet.Location: Ros#

 Let z be the amount of water in the aquarium. Veter 100 z mm to ft converts into 653 z ft. Then we know that 60 z274 = z mm.5 tons of water and z274 = z ft.5 waterft = z ft.54 = z m3.The answer is z m3.</s>#
