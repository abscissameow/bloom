 Let A be the number of times that Irene worked instead of the number of actual hours that she worked. Let w be 6000 (the regular pay) times 38 (number of hours worked last week) times A.Thus, A = 0.0059. w = 6000 + 20*A Thus, w = 6000 + (38 + 0.0059) = 6165.Answer:Institutional washers and dyers are willing to wash clothes for $8.50 a loads except for one#

 Irene runs for 20 hours (3×8). Combining constants she completed 8×10=80+20=90 minutes of overtime. An hour in economic terms is an hour of 40 minutes.

 LetW be Irene's earnings in weeks. Then W = 500 + 20 ⋅ 40 = $760. And let W0 be Irene's earnings in arbitrary units from 1 to 5. And have W1 + W2 + W3 + W4 + W5 = 40. Therefore  W0 = W1 +W2 +W3 +W4 + W5 = 50 ⋅ 5 + 20 ⋅ 4 = $160. So W0 = $160.That is, Irene's income is $160 because her "earnings" in weeks are $760.The answer is $160.question: A truck has a 32-piece wooden puzzle on its roof.

 The salary for 40 hours is $400. Arithmetically, if the number 40 is added to the number of worked hours of 50, both are equal to 100.Then, 120 - 100 -20 = $20 is the salary on overtime.The salary is $500.question: Margaret is earning 15 cents a word and $5 for each cover. The number of words in the chapters of the last 2 chapters is x and the number of chapters in the previous book is y.

 There are (900 + 80) - 400 = 80 hours working and Earning 100 hours plus $5 for 40 hours is $500. This equation is written as 900 - (80 + 80)/80 = 100 thus the solution is 900/100 = 10 times 100 Thus the solution is 900 /100 = 10. Therefore, Irene earned 2000. The answer is 2000. SOLUTION:Isolating 400from the equation 900 - (80 + 80)/80 gives 300 which is the correct answer.#

 She earned: 500 - 20 hours * 40/sem = 400 per week.Suppose her mastery level is two.Then she earned [ˈærəən] = 100*40/2 = 400 - 20 hours*200/65 = 385.5.But she only received 25/65 * 40h = 25h (not a single hour) after any overtime. So her full found annual income would be: 385.5 - 25h = 400 - 25h = 325.5h.The answer is 325.5.question: Let a, b and c be positive whole numbers.
