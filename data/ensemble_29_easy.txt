 Let S be the initial monthly income. Let P be the people's final monthly income. Let X be the rent and utilities. Then P = S + X. In this case P = S + 400. So we have P = S + (400 - 125) = S + 125.Then rearrange so that the final monthly income is 0 + 125 = 125.So the initial monthly income was 125 / (0 + 125) = 215.The answer is 215.question: John is constructing#

 Let x = her previous monthly salary.Then 29 x = 14400.87, or x = 14400.32.Let y = her current monthly income.So, her current monthly income is 14400.32 - 58 = 14400.13. Therefore, her previous monthly income is 14400.13 - 44 = 14400.08.Therefore, her previous monthly income is 14400.08.question: A pig shared a 7 hours long car trip with a linebacker, a quarterback, and a running back.

 Mrs. Snyder's monthly income, according to the algebra, would be $18,500 prior to improvement minus $600 after improvement = $16,400. Because her month's rent and utilities were $12,800, her monthly income after improvement was $16,400 - 12,800 = $12,200.After improving, her monthly income is $16,400 - 12,200 = $8,800.The answer is $8,800.question: Additionally, Mike#

 Mrs Snyder used to spend 30% of her monthly salary on rent and utilities. Let S be the amount of her monthly salary used for rent and utilities. Then if we add $600 (that's her newly increased salary) to S we'll get S + $600 = S + S or S = S.Then if we subtract S from 38% we'll get (S - S) = (S - S) or S = S.Therefore, Mrs. Snyder used $475 of her previous salary annually, or $3500 of her monthly salary in weekly intervals. The answer is $3500.question: Alison bought a mixture of $10 and $20 milk bar chocolates. She sold 6 chocolates to Patrick and $17 to Rhonda for#

 Since he/she had 75% of his/her previous income, then his performance this year would be 75 / 112 = 62%.Thus, Mrs. Snyder's percentage of salary this year would be 11 / 112 = 9.5%Of her going to rent and utilities was 25% of her previous salary.So your annual percentage rate is 12.5%question: Let x be the price of a house, and let y be the amount of money a homeowner needs.

 Her recent salary increase replaced a portion of her monthly income that she already spent on rent and utilities.Recall that her annual salary was $1,200 and that her monthly salary was $500.Well, her rent and utilities before the increase were $200.So her previous income was 1300 - 200 - 600 = 1100. She used that income to buy groceries for monthly and other expenses.In this their the previous income was 1100 - 200 - 600 = 900. So the increased income was 900 + 600 = 1300.The answer is 1300.For bank holidays, you may leave the answer as 'o'. question.There are 25 donkey banks.

 Let P now be the new monthly income.Script: P = P *(.25)2 =.1875*60 x 3 = $375LHS: P = P * (.25)2 = $375/.25 = $375/.4 = $250RHS: P = P * (.25)2 = $375/.18 = $136.So P = $136.The answer is $136.question: Using a scale of 1 cm through 3 inches,#

 Let x be the amount of what she used to spend.Then 2/3 * x was the total of her monthly income.Now, since she only spends 25%, the equivalent amount would be 1/2*x * 1/2 = 1/3*x.Which equates to x * 1/3 = x.Since everyone's monthly income used to be the same, then x = 1/3 * 285 = 126.Then it is also 1/2 * 126 = 126.Thus, her previous monthly income was 126.The answer is 126.#

 Mrs.  Snyder's previous monthly income was 1.2 + 2.4 = 3.8( stickman ).The  ratio between  rent/utilities and salary is  3/4.  So  Mrs.  Snyder's  new   income/ expenses   ratio equals ((3.8/4)+1) /2 = 0.9.  So  her   new   monthly   income  is  3.8 * ((0.9) 1/2) = 1188.Strictly speaking, the answer is 1188( not 1185 doses ) Question: There are repeated words in these text fragments.

 Let P be the total income and PR be the utility amount; then P + PR = Total income.If the new salary is 40% of the old salary, then (P - PR) * 40% of the old salary = New salary.(Total income - Utility amount)*40% = New Salary.The effort required to treat a patient is obviously a fixed amount of time.

 The monthly parental income equals subquery 2 in the conditional statement: if and only if 2 + 3 + 5 - 9 = 12, we know this parental income used to be 50% of her monthly income.Snyder was given 3 + 5 + 9 = 14, however she did not put this into the conditional statement.Therefore, the previous monthly income was 12.question: Jane has 4 pairs of hockey hats.

 Let m be the monthly salary. Let x be some percentage of total incomes. m * x = monthly income now: m * 0.25 of total income = monthly income formerly: m * 0.4 of total income = monthly income consequently: the monthly income formerly = m * 0.4 of total income = m * 0.8 of total income or: m = 0.8 of total income.The answer is 0.8  = 0.8 or Significantly Loss#

 Suppose that their monthly incomes are n1 and n2.Then we will have n2 = n1 + (1200 / 400 * 400), where 1 is remainders from the two division.Thus: n2 = n1 + (1600 / 400 * 404), where 400 is a remainders from the three division.Then n2 = n1 + (980 / 400 * 404), where 404 is a remainders from the four division.But when we take the difference n2 - n1, we have only remainders 800 and 400, so n2 - n1 = 80400 = 1600.The result is that the income of Mrs. Snyder was n1 = n2-80=1800.</s>Q:
