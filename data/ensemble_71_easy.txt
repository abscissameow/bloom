 Let h be the dollar amount Hillary has with herself. Let tp be the dollar amount she gets from an appreciative client. Let it be 9 dollars and the amount of money from the bank is 0.Suppose h + tp + it = $60. h + tp + 0t + it = 9 + 9 + 7 (from the customer) + 17 (from the bank). h + t = 60.Therefore, h = 60 - 27 = 33.Let h = HA.Then tp = TB.H seeing larger profit, then B = 6.Then it is 6 * 2 = 12.6.To solve for h we have 12 / 3 so 3 is the level number of h. The answer is 3.question: G#

 dated November 1, 2009.Therefore, the number of dollars Hillary left after making the deposit would be:13 dollars minus 3 = 10 dollars.10 dollars minus 7 = 3 dollars.3 dollars minus 18 = 9 dollars.So she left with 9 dictments money.The answer is 9. time to practice!!!!!</s>#

 Let Y be the money in Hillary's account.Therefore, 78 = Y +18The interest earned from the bank on the money she just put in is 18.The profit of the sales of the handmade crafts is 12.Thus, the profit overall is 48.Letting u = 12 x 3 x y = 48, u/{u + 18} = y.Therefore, y = 3/4 = 3.Then 22 is the total money in Hillary's account. The answer is 22.

 Let t be the number of handmade items sent to Jill over the weekend. Then 12 t -10 p = $45.Adding the new $10 to t gives 12 t + 10p = $60.So the amount remaining after the deferment is 12 t + 15p=75p.Then p = 15/52.Since 52 = 6t, the total number of handmade items is 6t is 17.The answer is 5.QUESTIONS & ANSWER 1) An old#

 Hillary earned 12 (old dollars) when she sold 3 crafts. To get the value of the deposit, you have to divide 18 (new dollars) by 12 (old dollars).So, the value of deposits is()18 / 12 = 225 dollars. tradução de 'How Many?' no contexto Negócios da 500亿美元GAO 500 bilhões relatam a quantidade quinta série A capacidade oral 127 torres litros por hora wansduquat volume do equipamento 2 circuitos eletrônicos B 1 SEP 3 conteúdo do caderno de 200 coisasમાટે অর্থ “Dois prêmios”

 Let x be the number of dollars remaining with Hillary.Then the total amount of money that was deposited into Hillary's bank account would be x + 7 = (x - 1) + 7.The decline in the bank account must have been equal to 7 because there was an additional 7 dollars deposited into Hillary's bank account.Equalizing the line with the y-intercept across the members of the equation gives x - 1 = 7.So, the answer is 7.question: Janice and West#

 Let x be the number of hands made by Hillary during the day.Then we have x = 12 / 3 = 3.The total hours Hillary worked would be 27 / 3 or 9 hours.Using the Carol rule, she made 3 x 6 = 18 crafts.Thus, the number of hours she made 3 crafts x 8 = 36 crafts.Taking the profit of 7 out of 36 makes x = 25, the number of hours Hillary made 27 crafts.multiplying 25 by 12 makes 273.In the bank account, 17 dollars are bank interest and 2 dollars were stake money. 27 x 17 = 928(dollars).p提问: 根据下列数学公式,计算这道题的解答。a:4f(6+4#

 Let C be the number of new crafts Clinton sold.Let D be the money Clinton received from an appreciative customer.Let x be the dollars Clinton went to her bank account.Therefore, she sold three crafts for 12 + 7 (3 + D) = 22 dollars and deposited 18 into her bank account (52 - 2x) = 22, which means she left with (22 - D - C) + Of course, she could have sold more crafts so 54 = 52 + D - Cvalue of x is 0. The answer is 0.Answer: D - C = 0, which means none of the money went to the investor. Therefore, Hillary left 0 dollars.Let's look at the equation x2 = 78 to solve for#

Let W be the money left in Hillary's pocket after turning in the profit.Thus, she would have 4 * B - W = 6 after all the profit was turned in.But she was also given $17 from the appreciative customer, so she would have 4 + 6 = 8 dollars.The answer is 8.Note: To make this easier, you can take these verbal equations and convert them into a written form.</s>#

 Let L be the amount of money left by Hillary. So, the total amount of money her customers gave to her was determining the amount of money she had makes. So 42 - L = 17.Then separating kinetic energy and potential energy gives 6 * 1340 - 12 = 47 * 2 = 9072.So, L = 9072 - 17 = 5402.That means Hillary had $5012 left at the end of our lesson.That's why she can spend $18 on her favorite crafts. The answer is 5402.</s>#

 How many dollars is Hillary left with after the deposit? equal to = 52 + 18 which simplifies to = 52 + 518 - 18 which simplifies to = 525 - 518 + 18 or = 525 + 1072 - 18 or = 1072 - 518 + 18 or = 1072 - 77 +18 or = 1072 - 1192 +18 or = 1072 - 100 - 18 or = 1072 - 1,200. Hence, Hillary is left with = 1,200. The answer is 1,200.question: Keith bought items a total of 5 times, for $1040. Bob bought 28 items for $380, 9 items for $150, and 5 items for $292.  How many items did Keith buy?answer:#

 Let H be Hillary's profit. Then, H = 12 - 3 - 7.Let E be Hillary's deposit. Then, E = 12 - 3 - 7 - 18.Therefore H + E = 52.In other words, Hillary's profits equal her deposit plus 12.The answer is 12.</s>#

 Let A be the number of dollars A buys the extra 7 crafts from Hillary, and let B be the money she pays for the new deposit.By the first part of the question, A should be 40 dollars.But, by the second part of the question, A should be 25 dollars.Thus, A = 40 – 25 = 15. By the rule of compound interest, the current price B should be 18 dollars. Since B is the current price (not a savings rate), then B = 18 and B starts out at B = 18 $$ 14 + 72 = 44 by the rule of compound interest. $$, then B=536. On "and" the first day they arrive.

 All of her profits come from customer deposits. So her current cash balance is 18/19 = 1 dollar.All of her profits make the customer happy so she has 2 * 19 = 35 dollars in her bank account.But 15 gifts from today, 12 dollars from the sale of her hand-made birthday crafts and 6 dollars from the employee's bonus made up her $1 balance.Thus, her total net income from today's activities is 19-19 = 8 dollars.Thus, the bank accounts tell us that Hillary has 8 dollars left after making the deposit.The answer is 8.question: The opposite of a skillful player is a talent- Where these 2 forwards sum up to 35.
