 Sat 9:12am today, she read 23 pages.  She read 12 pages yesterday.  So the number of pages she read yesterday is 12 x (1/23) = 4 pages.  And the number of pages she read today is 23 - 4 = 19 pages today.  So the number of pages that she read yesterday is 19 x 24/12 = 7 pages.  Then the number of pages that she reads tomorrow is (23 - 7)/8 = 84 pages.  The answer is 84.question: Let n#

 Let r be the number of pages that Julie reads tomorrow.Yesterday, she read r pages and today, she read twice that much. Since the number of remaining pages is 120 - 2*r - 8 = 82, the number of pages that she reads tomorrow should be twice as women as r plus 1/2. Thus, she reads twice as many pages as she did yesterday.Thus, her daily reading is (182 - 12)r = 15 pages.That is, she reads 15 pages on each of her x = 6 days.Therefore, the number of pages read by Julie is mb = 1 + (6x*12 = 180).The answer is 180.Question number #30.A taxi driver stops his taxi at a light and his#

 Let x be the number of pages that Julie reads. John. N = 12 x 42. So 12 + 2 = 14 x 2 = 42. Then 12 - 14 + 2 = 27 x 2 = 72. 42 + 18 = 72. This is the number of pages that Julie should read tomorrow. The yesterday's reading is included in today's reading.So, there are 72 pages that Julie has left to read tomorrow. Then half of this is 24 = 42 / 2.

 Let X be the number of pages that Julie read on Tuesday. From noon to 2 p.m., she was able to read 53 - X - 126 = 66 pages. Therefore, from noon to 2: 0 = 66 - 52 = 24 Major.For next Tuesday, between noon and 2 p.m., she read 66 - X = 24 pages. Therefore, for tomorrow she will read 36 - X = X = 24 pages.The answer is 24.question: Let H be the number of#

 Let T be the number of pages remaining tomorrow.Then: T = 120 - (12 + 12 * 2) = 84T = 120 - M / 2 for M = 12 + 12 * 2.And M = T / (M + 1) for M = 120 - 12 - 2 = 84.Therefore, to seek T, T - M = 2 and T = 84 - 12 - 18 = 70.The answer is 70.question: Bagheera gave 4 switches to Amber,#
