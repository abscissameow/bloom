 Let x be the additional money Betty needs. Then the new wallet costs 2x.Then the parents gave 15x to Betty.Divided by x, this leaves Betty with (15x + 100 - x) = 325x.Simplify, to find x.So x = 55/60So the additional money needed to purchase a new Wallet is 325/55 = 45.The answer is 45.question: If Julia calls Tina 3 times and Angela 1 time, how many calls will Tina#

 Betty wasted her money by giving it to her parents and grandparents.Her total use of money was $55. She had $139 to begin with.Also, she had to have at least $12.4 to buy the wallet on top of spending her $15.Transferring $5 from the left side and $10 from the right side of the equation brings the total to $14.20.Therefore, Betty needed 89.20 - (49.00 - 12.40) = $85.00 for the wallet.The full answer is 85.question: Dori bought an applesauce latte and forgot to add the a $.85 charge to the price tag.

 Let b = the amount needed to buy the wallet.Then let p be the amount her parents gave.This is the amount she has + the amount that her grandparents gave her.Let me parenthesize this so we can move these patterns together.These automated formulas will help with putting tuples together in a maximum satisfying list.  Let a = P x F. Let B = G x H. Then we have: if a + B >= H then a = H - B else a = 0 and if a + B < H then a = H - B else a = a + BSo sometimes b = 0.And without the parenthesis optional, the following equation results: (G x H <= M) (I x S - p x B >= 0#

 Let M be the total amount of money Betty has. Then B = M - 15 Thus, 55 = M - 15 Since Betty still has $50 after her parents gave her the money, our final answer is 54.So, Betty needs to save another#

 Let X be the amount of money needed by Betty. Then she has 15 = X/2 + X.Then the grandparents are twice as much who took away 15 = X + 2*X, making the total of the individual amounts equal to X + 16 at Stanford, Women's Silicon Valley Leadership Conference.</s>Introduction
The genus Macrozygites was first described by (Petersen, 1904) for a single species in Mesopotamia. The genus Macrozygites is one of the larger groups of the humble-bees native to the Middle Eastern and Northern Iraq, representing most of the subgenus Psagomyrmex within the tribe Geometroidea. Approximately 70 species have been recorded worldwide. The subgenus (Macrozygites s. str.) has 16 described species so#

 Let x be the amount of money Betty needs to get the wallet. Then Betty will get it if she has x + 155 = 100. Since her grandparents gave her a total of 55, she has 5 + 55 = 100. Therefore, her amount of money is 5.The answer is 5.question: Dawn, Zach and their friend Brian each brought $5. They bought a sandwich from a restaurant. Brian and Dawn got half of their sandwich on the way and Zach took the other half home#

 Money needed by Betty = 115.Distribute 59 = 15 to 25, so $50 = 15 + 25.Subtract twice $25 from $50, so the money needed by Betty is $50 - $15 - $25 = $55.Note: Answering:Multiply each equation by grasp 40! question:Daryn had 111 yo-yo balls to play when a friend came over.  He played 45 of them.  If Daryn had played 50 of them, how many balls would he have had left#

 If x is the number of money saved, we have split the equation in two terms. X + 15 = B and x + 53 - B = $ 105.Which are a simple equation in x. Breaking into two where the sum is x and subtracting the constant gives the equation as (x + 15)(x - 53) = 0. Solving the equation gives x = 17.The answer is 17.question: Mike once answered the phone during the morning break with a question.#

 Let B be the number of $50 bills needed. Then B = 80 - (15 + ((75 - 15)/2) - ((75 - 15)/2) = 55. Distribute B to the three values. Let B = 50 - 15 = 35. Therefore, the number of $20 bills needed is 35 + 25 = 60.Distribute 35 to 15. Let T be 25, so the amount of $35 is 70. Therefore, the number of $1 bills needed is 70 - 35 = 35. The answer is 35.question: Often, in gym class, Chloe, Kyle and Ezra sit in a circle. They always move to the opposite side when someone sits in the middle. The third person always sits just ahead of the#

 Let x be the amount of money she needs by herself. This is (100 - $15) / 2.Now since her parents are giving her $15, then she cannot use the money in such a way that her parents do not get it. If we call the money in her pocket - the money in her parents' pocket as y, then we have x = 100 - 15 - 2*y = 50 - y - y = y.Which simplifies to x = 50 - 15*(1 - 2*y / (14 + y)).Because y = x / 2 we get x = 50 - 15 / (1 - 2*y / (14 + y)).Since β = 15 / (14 + y) = (y - 1) / (14 + y), we find half of the money needed: x = (y - 1) / (14 + y) /2.The answer is (y - 1) / (14 + y) / 2 = (40 + y#

 Betty only needs $45 to buy the wallet.But since Betty only has $45.75.So her parents need to give her $45 - 0.75 = 43.25.Then Betty's grandparents need to give her $43.25 susruce of her $45, so their contribution is 0.75 x 44.Therefore, Betty needs to tap $46 to buy her wallet. The solution is 46 $40.75 = $21 50.25.The answer is 21.question: John likes real-time fantasy football and wants to play for real life. The problems is players only guess which teams to play rather than telling one the truth so they not really know the names of the teams. So, if John plays against#

 In order to buy the wallet with $100, Betty needs to have $180 in her pocket. جعلت المال بالمال وجعلت المظلمة مظلمة. Therefore, Betty would need 15 * 15/2 = 45 dollars from her grandparents.The grandparents would have 225 dollars.</s>

 To buy the wallet, Betty needs 90 dollars, so she must save 6 * (100 - 90) = 180 dollars (to get the money she needs) from her grandparents and earn 180 - (15 - 30) = 90 dollars from her parents. The equation now becomes 180 - (15 + 30) = 90.Solving this equation with division gives 54 = (180-15)/15 - 30.Thus, Betty needs 54 * 100 = 540 dollars from her parents.The answer is 540.question: Had a party with 40 people.

 Betty's grandparents gave her a gift twice as much as her parents gave her a gift.Therefore, Betty needs to buy the wallet with a total of (150 - 149) $100's. And there are 49 $100's remaining in her pocket. Let x be the number of $100's. Then the number of remaining $100's is 100 - (x - 50)100 = 50x + 50 = 150. Combine the even terms and get: 750 - x = 150Then, divide by (750 - x) x = (170 - x) x = (49 - x) x = 50x + 5 = 150.Thus, x = 50.The answer is 50.question:ctan3, tan2, and tan solve the#

 Betty received $15 from her mother.Then she received $25 from her Grandmother.So, if she wants to buy her wallet for $75 then, her grandparents will have to give her at least twice the amount claimed by her mother.Using the standard formula, we can write her equation as: 40 = (5 + 2) x 100.Using the additive property of $= {x + y} = {x + y} = 60 as well, we can rewrite the above as:60 = 70 - (5 + 2) x 100.Note that $5 = 80 - (5 + 2) x 100.Thus we have30 = 50 - 20 = 40 = (5 + 2) x 100.

 Let x be the number of meatloaf dinners and let y be the number of turkey dinners.So x + y = 50.The total cost is 100 + 25(x + y) = $100.On the left, x + y is multiplied by 1/2. On the right, the multiplication is 1/2 * 125 = 62.Adding x to both sides gives 50 + 62 = 103.The constant is 1+(5)2 = 1.Making 1 cancel out, we have 103 - 16 = 90.Then y is x/2.Therefore, the answer is x/2 = 50.The answer is 22.question: A charcoal grill heater costs $10, and a propane grill heater costs $3.5.#
