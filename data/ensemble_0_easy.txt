 Let x be the number of clips She sold in April. Let y be the number of clips She sold in May. Then x + y = 48.Then x =.5 (48 + 45).Then y = 48 - (1 -.5) = 45.Combining the two expressions with the same radical yields x + y = 18and the tensors cancel out. Due to the addition of 1 behind both variables, the solution to this problem is x = (48+45)/(45-18)=1.25.The answer is 1.onelocked question is: Jennifer walked 3 {@inheritdoc} miles Monday and 2 {@inheritdoc} miles Tuesday. She walked 4 {@inheritdoc} miles Wednesday, 5 {@inheritdoc} miles Thursday, y {@inheritdoc} miles Tuesday, and 4#

 Let A be the number of clips that Natalia sold in April.Let B be the number of clips that Natalia sold in May.During these two periods, Natalia sold: 48 x 35 + 30 x 35 = 1725 clips.ELA's does without S, W, and Z Sounds as strings</s>This invention relates to a process for preparing molybdenum copper alloy and activated molybdenum copper alloy, which are useful as alloys for processing high-temperature gas and liquid cooled reactor tubes.

 Natalia sold 20 clips in April and 25 in May. So she sold 80 clips in total.The number (80 - 20 - 25 )/25 = 8(x - 1).This is then divided by 2 to give the answer as 3.The#

 Let x be the number of clips sold in April. Let y be the number of clips sold in May. Then the function can be written as.Q=48*x + Truman = 48*50/100 + 500/-(48*5) = 60 Paman = 48*60/100 + 2000/-52 = 2200 Uncle Brent = 48*60/100 + 2000/-52 = 2100 Questions are above the lines. x-y = -x = 146-50 = 122. Then -122 = -52. Dividing by 50 will make both equations the same, because -122 / 50 = -52 / 50 = 122 / 50 thus Dividing both sides of both equations by 50 will give both equations equal to the difference between the values of -122 and#

 Let x be the number of clips sold in April. Then x+1 clips were sold in May.Thus we need to solve the equation (x+8)/2=48.The expression simplifies to 2x=48.And the value of x = 3.So, the number of clips sold in April was 3x=6 clips.The number of clips sold in May was 3x rested the 2x sold in April so the equation is 3x = 3x + 2x = 6 clips.Then transfer 2x = 4 clips (comes from 10x = 50 and 10x + 2x = 50 + 2x = 60 from 50x = 500 and 50x + 2x = 500 + 2x = 600) to the left side so the equation simplifies to 3x = 6x#

 Let C be the number of clips sold by Natalia in April. Then the number of total clips sold was 2 x C + B = 120 clips.Accounting for what happened in May on the way to knowing the totals gives us the following equation:In April, 29 clips were sold.So 29 tubes + 23 = 50 as the answer for C in April.In May around this time, the tubes were sold.There are now 60 clips left.So there were 40 tubes sold in May as#

 Let n be the sum of April's and May's sales. Then the number of clips sold in April is 48 * (51 - n) = 94668.And the total number of clips sold in April and May would be 481 - n = 95488.So, the number of clips sold overall would be n = 94668 - 95488 = 27152.The answer is 2700.question: Rob gradually increased the temperature of a tank so that the water in the tank temperature increased by#

 Let x be the number of clips that Natalia sold in April. Then we have 26*x+18 = 64.Then we have equal the sum of two pieces: x + 18 = 64 + 8=72.Then we can simplify this in one variable: 2x + 18 = 72.And we want x to equal 21.Therefore, x = 21 and 26*x+18 = 72.Therefore Natalia sold 72 clips in April.Let 77+18 = 83 clips in May.How many clips did Natalia sell in all of April and May?answer:  We had 3 x 17 = 65 clips.Therefore we added 17 to both sides: 18 + 3 x 17 = 65 + 17 = 72.And then we multiplied by two to#

 Let x be the number of clips that Natalia sold in May of the year, and let s be the number of clips sold in April of that year.Then, when coming to month March, Natalia sold (x+s)/2 clips.Adding March's x = 48 and April's s = 50 clips, we get 48 + (50 + x/2)/2 = 58.Here x + s = 58.This simplifies to x + s - 28 = x + (50 - x)/2.Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 1/2 gives the desired result x=50 - 28 = 7.In other words, Natalia sold 50 clips in April, and 7 in March.The answer is 7.question: Maria picked fruit from Mango#

 Let x be the total number of clips in April and let y be the total number of clips on May.Then the number of clips sold in April becomes (x +y equal 550. Then the number of clips sold in May becomes (50 + 50 = 100). Therefore the increment is 2x.Let the price per clip be p.Then the sales increment is p*2x = 120.Then the number of cents that Natalia earned as she sold clips in April is 120*.48= $3440We have to multiply by 100 to find out the dollar amount.Therefore, Natalia earned y= =124 cents for each clip in May. Now subtract 126 cents that Natalia earned in April.The final number that we need is x+y -#

 Let y be the number of clips sold in April.Then, we know that 21 - 48y = 4.Summing terms gives 504 = 2 years later.Yet, both 52 and 4 are divisible by 12.  Formula tells us that (52 + 4) / 12 = 22. Meanwhile, (48 + 4) / 12 = 46. Therefore, y = 45. Meanwhile, the answer is 45.question: Imagine that there is a Big V store near the park.  While you're waiting in#

 For April, we have 8 clips sold - 48 = 4 clips left. For May, we have 4 clips left - 5 = 1 clip left.So, for both months, there is 1 clip sold.The total number of clips that were sold is 24 * 1 + 15 * 1 = 48.The answer is 48.question: Felipe is using two tables for his math homework. On the first day he laid off 5 formulas and 3 results on a sheet, and on the last day he#

 Let x be the number of clips that Natalia sold on April.The number of clips on April is (23 -4) + 3 = 20.The number that Natalia sold on May is (13 -4) + 3 = 11.So the number of clips sold by Natalia on April and May is (23-11)+16=42.The answer is 42.question:  Oz gave 10 letters each to Marta, Herlinda, and Netsa so they could start a new club.

 Let 1 be the number that Natalia sold in April. Let 2 be the number that Natalia sold in May.Let 3 be the number of days in April.Let 4 be the number of days in May. Then 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 53.So, Natalia made 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 53 clips in April. However, there were 28 days left in April, and she therefore also had to sell 1 clip in each of the remaining 25 days. In May, Natalia also had to sell 18+1 = 19, and by the end of May, the total number of clips she had sold was also 53. Thus, her total number of clips sold was 53 + 19 = 74.If she sold an#

 Let X be the number of clips she sold in April.Then, let Y be the number of clips she sold in May.Then, let X*Y be the total number of clips Natalia sold.Then, let X and Y be the sums of X and Y.Then, we have 48 * (58 - 36) = 120(53 - 8) = 1760(47 - 12) = 1040And X = 48 * 56 - 8 = 871 and Y = 48 * 34 - 12 = 271.Therefore, X*Y = 608.Then, the total number of clips sold by Natalia in April and May is 608 = (871 + 271) * 2 = 2043.Therefore, the answer is 2043.#
