 Every piece of hamburger costs 1 * 3 = 3.Thus the total costs of the hamburgers for all 5 of them would be 3 * 5 = 15.Each set of French fries costs 1 + 3 = 4.Thus their total costs would be 4 * 4 = 16.Each cup of soda costs 0.5 + 1 + 3 = 0.5 * 2 = 1.5.Thus their total costs would be 1.5 * 2 = 2.Therefore, the total costs of all their food would be 15 + 16 + 2 = 29.Thus, Alice planned to pay $29.So her friend Bob is paying since he has the last train.The cure for Bob's illness is 13 tokens, so his fee#

 Let x be number of french fries divided by 2 and then added to the total. Similarly for soda and hamburger, but instead of giving 1/2 on each of the parts you will give 3/4 on each of them. Then (unicycle * x/4 + ecuba)/2 = x/4 and eplatanos = x + 1 + (x/3 + 1/8).Therefore, (unicycle * 2/4 + ecuba)/4 = (4/1 + 1/3)/2 = 3/2. Let X = 1/2 * 1 + 3/2 = 2/3. Let Y = 1 * 1/2 + 3/2 - 8 = 2 / 2 * 2), so 77 + 53 = 38.Let x = 2 * 2/3 / 4 = 7/3, so 7/9 = 7/3 with 29/30 = 0. worksheet over.b. a. 5×1 = 5. b. 15/3 = 7. c. 94/3 = 77. d. 2*9/3 = 21. e. 73/3 = 77g.#

 The quantity that each person will pay for the hamburger is: 5 * 3 + 4 * 1.2 + 5 * 0.5 + 1 * 2.7 = $39. And the quantity that each person will pay for the French fries is: 5 * 1.20 + 4 * 0.5 + 1 * 2.7 = $1.64. To make a total that is $39. similar to m9 = 61 How did you get the difference? All you these are the rare connect, here is a technique. Let n - 8 = t (1) then n1 + m9 = 61 - 8 = 59 (2) n3 + m3 = 61 - 8 = 59 (3) so n1 + n3 = 60 (4) m9 is a divisor of 60 and is 60/0189 as i get on course. so m9 + m1 = 62 (5). so n should be 123, but we know n = 123/2187.</s>#

 Let x be the amount paid by one friend and p be the amount paid by the others.Then, we have: x = 3 + (1.20 + 0.5) + (1.20 + 0.5) + (0.5 + 0.5) = 8.25.In the other way, we have: p = 3 + 2 + (1 + 0.5) + (2 + 0.5) = 6.4 which can be simplified to 3 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4.Thus, the total amount you pay is 8.25 + 4 =12.25 cents. The answer is 12.25.question: Carlos has made a withdrawal totaling $2,700 this week. He#

 First of all, let P be the amount each of them pays.Then 5 x 3 + 4 x 1.20 + 5 x 0.5 + 2.7 = PTake the last equation and multiply both sides by x to get 5 * 3 * x + 4 * 1.20 * x + 5 * 0.5 * x + 2.7 * x = PTake the following two equations and place their values on the brackets: 4 * 1.20 * x = 1.2 + 0.8x = 2.7x = 2.95So, 5 * 3 * x + 4 * 1.20 * x + 5 * 0.5 * x + 2.7 * x = 2.95 * x = PTake the bracketed value in the previous equation and add in the value of P in the original equation to get a final equation.5 + 2.95 = 3.95So, P = 3.95.

 The total cost of what they ordered is 90.Let x be the amount that one friend will pay.We want to find how many friends will pay x.So we need to solve the expression for y.The first term of the summation is $5.This indicates that each friend has to pay 0.5 * 5 = 2 for a single piece of spaghetti.  The second term of the summation is $1.2. This indicates that each friend has to pay 0.5 * 1.2 = 0.4 for three sets of french fries. The third term of the summation is $0.5 * $0.5 = $0.25. The fourth term of the summation is $1.20. This indicates that each#

 For X, we let X1 denote the number of hamburger, X2 denote the number of fries, X3 denote the number of soda, and X4 denote the number of spaghetti.X1+X2+X4+X3 = 5*2+1.20+(0.5*0.6)+(2.7/8) = $15.Weldon ordered 3 * 12 * 5*12 = 1060 MENTA-BOLIVES which cost $0.08. We can distribute the cost evenly among the five people. Therefore, we let the number of MENTA-BOLIVES that Weldon can get be 5*x1/x5 = 16M. We let y denote the number of bananas that they shared. So, (y + 8) / 5 = 2 x1/x9 = 2 × 6.20 ∈ B (30)

 Let x be the price of the hamburger.Let y be the price of the French fries.Let z be the price of a soda.Let w be the price of spaghetti.Dividing the terms giveswxz = x(y + z)w = x + (y + z)w = 2p + 2wLikewise, we havewxz = y(x + z)x = 2p + 2w Likewise, we havewxz = z(x + z)p = 2p + 2wSo the total price would be 2p + 2(p + w) = 2p + 5w = 9.The price to the five of them would be 9.

 Let 'n' be the number of hamburgers,'s' be the number of sets of fries and 'a' be the number of sodas that each of these eat. Then n + s + a = 5.Using base 10, we have: N = ten; S = two; A = zero.And we know that 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 8 using the facts that 9 = 2 * 5, 7 = 2 * 3 and 3 = 1 + 2. This means that n = 4.Substituting N for n and simplifying, we get: N = 4 * 10 = 40; As = 0 + 40 = 40; sas = 1 + zero + 40 = 40; so s = 40.We don't know how many sets of french fries are being ordered (0 = 0). Therefore, to find the cost of the French fries the following must equal 8: n = 4, As = 4, sas = 1, s = 40.Therefore, the cost#

 The total bill is $16.5, so their bills are $11.65 for the hamburger and $4.20 for the other items. And they are to pay that to each other. They are to pay $8.2 for the hamburger, $0.5 for the soda, $1.20 for the french fries, and $0.7 for the spaghetti.The answer is 8.2 + 0.5 + 1.20 + 0.7 = 14.3.#

 Let x be the total cost of the food and drink, and y be the number of pieces of hamburger and French fries.Then the total cost would be x + y.Because all the food costs the same amount, so would x.Then the cost of the food and the drinks would be x + y = 6.Now if we eliminate y, we would get the equation x = 6.Which should yield a solution of x = 5. So it's likely we will get x = 5. Furthermore the discriminant tells us that the only positive root would be x = 5. Thus, the only solution to the above set of equations is x= 5.answer : Kelly is giving baseball cards away for a price. She is doing fine#
