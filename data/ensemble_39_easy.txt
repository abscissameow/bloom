 Let x be the number of houses Anna goes to on a given day.Marta's house is 1, Bill's house is 5. Her neighbor in the first subdivision has x houses and each of her neighbors is 1 - x. So she has 65 - 1 - 5 = 64 houses in total going in two directions.On a given day, she will go to x houses. To go from her first subdivision to the first of her neighbors, she will save 1/2 x of her total going home, minus 1/3 of the total she goes to her first neighbor each day. Thus she will make an average eat of x/2 - 1/2 * x * (X -1) / 3 = 1.12x/2(X - 1) / 3#

 Let X be the number of additional candy pieces for Anna. Then, 21 - 14 - 11 = 4.Distribute 4 to X so it becomes 21/4 = 4. Then X = 16.But X includes 2 pieces of candy from Billy's house.Subtract 2 from X, so X = 14.Tit 2 from the candy, so the left side of the equation becomes 14 - 2(14 + 11 + 1 + 41 + 4 + 41) = 6.Then distribute 4 to the left side to obtain 4(14 + 11 + 1 + 41 + 4 + 41) = 6So, the number of candy pieces that Billy got is 6.The answer is 6.Question 5: Zeke and Charlie found#

 Let B be the amount of candy that Anna gets. Then A addition T the first subdivision has 60 + 35 = 95 houses. Then the second sub-division has 75 + 25 = 125 houses. multiplying both sides of the equation by B, which is 15 comes out: (95 + 135)*B = 150 at the right side of the equation, we have T*B which equals 725. And multiply them to rid off the constant 55, come up with B(145*75 = 725), the answer is 725.question: Anna bought a cake from fresh market and charged onclick="calCakePrice('52');" id="cb54" price="56,1" The imbalance between the purchase price and the cash was $#

 Let a be the number of pieces of candy Anna gets per house in the first subdivision.b be the number of pieces of candy she gets in the second subdivision.Then 13*a + 11*b = 60 * a + 75 * b.By definition, a = 0.5 * B and b = 0.5 * A. Thus, a = 15 / (60 + 75) = 45 / 60 = 0.67 and b = 7 / (60 + 75) = 11 / 60 = 0.16.So, the first subdivision has 60 * 0.67 = 30 pieces of candy and the second subdivision has 75 * 0.16 = 10 pieces of candy. The total amount of candy that Anna gets is 30 + 10 = 40 pieces of candy, as expected.The answer is 40.question: Jamie has six engineers on his team and Fox has six designer on his team.

 Let C be the number of Cinders that Anna gets. Let D be the number of candies that Billy gets.Then, (59 - B) + 71 = C + D.So, Zakes gets C - D because there is no one in both subdivisions. Then, 55 - 39 = 10.And the number of Cinders is 55 + 59 - 10 = 90.Thus, Bourqes gives 10 Cinders to Anna and 55 to Billy which shoudl result in a total of 85 pieces.This is false. There are 110 pieces of candy in both subdivisions but because Billy gives Alexander Bouquest a piece, they have 109 pieces. The other piece (which Bonnie received from Bouquest) does not affect the#

 Let A be the number of candy pieces obtained by Anna in the first subdivision and let B be the number of candy pieces obtained by her brother in the second subdivision.Then, 84 - (A+B) = 70 pieces of candy.Adding A and B, producing 12, creates 40, and adding 12 and 70 totaling 73 gives the answer 70.question: Today Ginny's birthday. She is celebrating it at a party with nine of her friends. She plans to#

 Let x be the number of candy pieces Anna gets. Let x be the sum of all the candy the first subdivision gets. Then let y be how many candy pieces the second subdivision gets.It would make sense to solve B = x + y.Then, subtracting the second subdivision's candy from the first subdivision's candy we would have (x - y) = B.To solve for x, we have x = B - y.Then x(x - y) = BN.Thus, the equation simplifies to 15B - 89 = 8.Solving for B equation becomes 15(15 - 8) = 45.The answer is 45.QUESTIONSECTION# 2Grammar#

 Since there aren't zero houses on either subdivision, the first subdivision has a total of N houses, where N = x + y + z. So, subtract 1 from N. Then the second subdivision has a total of NM houses. Then the number of pieces of candy that Anna gets is: N x 15 = 540 pieces of candy.Theanswer is 540.Question 1: The coin system on page 32 is a coin that has three neighboring coins with the right coin being one million dollars#

 Let Z be the number of pieces of candy that Anna gets. Let X and Y be the number of houses in the first and second subdivisions, respectively. Therefore, there are (X + Y) X = 15 + 11 = 24 houses. Using the definition of a haves gives Z = 15 X We have slightly simplified by taking out the whole house form, since Anna has to walk to, so we have V = Z / (X + Y) = Z / (15 + 11) = 5. So there are 5 trick-or-treaters in each municipality.question: Harry installed an alarm system in his house.

Solve.Solve to get.Let be the number of houses in a subdivision where Billy goes trick-or-treating.Then we have, and.Subtracting the expression also gives now rearrange and simplify.Solving for b yields 8 +.And both of the above fractions must satisfy the equation.Subtracting 8a from equation yields.Solving for we have.Therefore, the overall answer is 31b +.The answer is 7.tips:#

 Let x be the number of candy received for an item.Then, 60 x 14/17 = 11 x 11/17Thus, the number of candy received from a first subdivision multiplied by the number of houses it has is multiplied by the number of candy received per house from a second subdivision.Therefore, the candy stumped into Anna's subdivision is 11x/5.Now, we multiply 12 by 5, so the total amount Anna received in 5 trips is 12x/5 = 120.Therefore, the first subdivision had 60 x 120/5 = 2745 pieces of candy, and not 3000 pieces of candy.The answer is 2745.answer: Magician A does 27 tricks in 20 minutes, magician#

 Let X be the total number of candy pieces Anna receives. Then, X = 17 x 4 + 11 x 4 = 125.Let Y be the number of candy pieces Billy gets. Then, Y = 14 x 3 + 11 x 3 = 62.So X-Y = 41 = B. Since A = L, then X = 14 + 11 x 3 = 35. Since Y = B + 11 x 3 = 62, then X = 14 + 11 x 3 = 35 + 11 x 3 = 54/38 = 1.618.Power 400 = 1.6. Multiply 1.6 by 400 = 641. The answer is 65.</s>#

 Let x be the number of candy pieces that have already been distributed.Then 15 + 14 = 29 pieces have been distributed.Let y be the number of candy pieces that Billy collected.Then 11 + 11 = 22 pieces have got Amy.Both special ingredients count as 2 so the mixture has 24 pieces. Therefore, Anny gets 30 pieces.The answer is 30. An additional answer is 12.question: Two women Lisa and Pepsi bought identical products. Lisa paid $5 for her water bottle#

 Let A be the number of pieces of candy given out by Anna in the first subdivision.And let B be the number of pieces of candy given out by Billy in the second subdivision.Then the number of candy pieces given out by Anna is A + (59 -14) = 55.And the number of candy pieces given out by Billy is B + (75 -11) = 78.And the total is A + B = 57 + 28 = 99.Assume each of the subdivisions has 30 houses, which is the same number in the first and second subdivisions.Then A = B + 30 - 45 - 78 = 30.Which leaves us in an equality and we can solve by substitution A = 30 - (#
