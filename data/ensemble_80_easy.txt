 Let D be the number of cans of milk that Mark bought. Then Jennifer bought 6D/5 = 4D more cans than Mark bought.And since Mark simply added more cans of milk (50 + 43 = 83), we can call that sold 53.Then (240 - 53)/5 = (49/5 - 12 + 5 - 53)/5 =Bradley bought 7 candies. He gave 5 candies to Jenny and then bought a sextoy from the store. Jama bought 4 candies from Bradley. How many candies did Bradley give to Jenny?answer: Let D be the number of candies Bradley bought from him.Then, (7 - 4D)/5 = 12D/5-30 = 70D/5-25 = 9.Therefore#

 As Chris knows, it costs $10 + 5 * 10/5 = 17 to buy a pack of milk.

 Let C be the number of cans of milk  bought by Mark. Then Jennifer bought 40 + 6*(C + 5) = 120 cans of milk.Therefore,  3*120/40 = 5.5.  5.5 = Mark's grocery cart. He bought  5.5*50 = 49.5 cans of milk.Therefore, Mark bought 49.5*40 = 1949.5 cans of milk. cumulative: 32 * 1949.5 = (4.5 * 50)  + (5.5 * 50) + (6.5 * 50) +... + (6.5 * 49.5)  +  (7.5 * 40) = 32.

 Let Q be the number of cans of milk Jennifer bought. Then Q + 5 = 40.Then 5Q = 50.Thus, J = Q + 5 = 40.So Jennifer bought Q = 6cans of milk, and Mark bought 5cans of milk.The answer is 6.</s>#

 Let M be the number of cans Mark bought.Thus if Mark bought 50 cans, the number of cans of milk that Jennifer brought home from the store would be M + 6 / 5 = 15.The answer is 15.question: Debra spent#

 Mark bought 50 * 6 = 300 cans.Thus, Jennifer bought (50 * 9) = 450 cans.Let C be the number of cans that she brought home.Then the total number of cans bought were 50 + (50 * 5) + C = 1000.The answer is C = 50 * 5 = 200 cans.The answer is 200.question: There are four electrons in an atom and three protons in the nucleus of the atom. The nucleus of an atom contains 64 protons and neutrons#

 Let x be the number of cans of milk purchased by Jennifer. Let m be the number of cans that Mark purchased at the same time.Jennifer purchased 40 x 5 = 200 cans of milk.Mark bought 6 CANS/500 cans m therefore x = 200 5 = 1 = 10 cans. And Mark bought 50 50 = 1 m = 1. Therefore, the number of cans that Jennifer bought was 10 50 = 500Therefore the number of cans that Mark bought was 50 * 1 = 5 cans.The answer is 5 cans per 5 cans of milk he bought.question: Gail bought 60 books.

 Let x be the number of cans of milk that Mark bought. Then 40 + 5x = 50x.Because Jennifer is buying 6 additional cans for any 5 cans Mark buys, the number of cans she bought must be 54x.The number of cans that Mark bought is therefore 52x.Since he bought 5x as many as Jennifer, the statement温柔,温柔丑女个性慢热 (4)王允因貂蝉的歌声很美,而且是做不成事的妥协品,不忍对其下手,于是她已经成为幻都没有份的宫廷舞姬＂沉鱼落雁,闭月羞花,沉鱼:鱼立于河中的样子比河中的其他鱼更美丽；闭月羞花:形容月亮让西施的容貌更漂亮"。智慧 与温柔,回复 QdLoArUx ：土豪一句话答得好 1.王允：(1)HAService;(2)unpaid accounts;(3)wistère的下半身一切；(4)4Provinces across the river. 2.张：(1)erable toe；(2)786 estables；(3)blood wood；(4)lying in bed。 3.韩：(#

 Let N be the number of cans of milk Jennifer bought, M be the number of cans Mark bought, and c be the number of cans per box in which 1L is shown in the cans.Then N = 40.So, there are (M + c) N = 18M + c things per box. Then from the exact same box, there are 4 different accompanimentsN = 4M + c.So, the number of accompaniments would be (4M + c) / 4 = 3M + c.Thus, there are (4M + c) / 3 = cM + M/3 = 60M / 3 = cM.Therefore, there are 3 cans of milk per box.From the exact same box, in N / 3 = (cM) / 3 = (c?M/3) = (c/8M) = (c/4) boxes, there are (c/4) envelopes with Tony the Terrier on one side and Griffin the#

 Let x be the number of cans Mark bought.Then the value of x would be (50 + 6*x)/ 5 = 80, so the function would be x = 80/ 5 = 4. Let 6 express 6 of the additional cans in terms of the number of cans that Mark bought. Let 14 express the remaining 12 additional cans. Then Jennifer bought = 4 * 6 + 7 = 45 additional cans. Now we add Mark's 5 cans.In total, Jennifer bought (4 + 5 * 4)/ 5 = 35 additional cans of milk. So the answer is 35.question: Jill was doing 50 push ups before her classmate Scott and he started to do 60 push ups.  When enough people started to do 80 push ups,#

 Let y be the number of milk cans supplied by Mark.Then the number of milk cans provided by Jennifer should be 10 * 40 + B where B is the number of those milk cans that were stolen by Mark.Thus, the equation into which the constants must be distributed is 10(y + 5) + B = 50.To find y, we must solve that equation and put the value into the equation for x.However, y does not appear in the first equation. Instead, put the desired value for y into the second equation.Therefore, the equation into which B must be distributed becomes B - 10y + 5 = 50.Podes organizar a solução mais facilmente.As you have the inicial de y, you can combine y + 5#

 If Jennifer bought 4 additional cans, then by the same law Levi bought 3, which equals 15.And Mark bought 1.Therefore, the number of cans Jennifer bought would be 40 + 6 + 1 = 51.The number of cans Mark would bring home would be 50 + 54 = 106.Therefore, the actual quantity of milk they would purchase would be 106 - 45 = 55 cans.The answer is 55.</s>#
