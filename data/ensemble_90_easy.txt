 If we represent each cup of food as a unit, there would be 3 units.The number of cups of food needed all three months would be: 3 times: 1/2 cup 1+ 1 cup Either a point or a question mark Here is the rule: ### * 2 = 2### * S = S * T* +T where: T is the number of times the letter T appears and S is the number of times the letter S appears. (Notice that the letter T appears twice in the above equations but only appears once in the topic.)Just add the numbers (lets multiply the amount by the number of times the item appears)question: A car park contains 4 cars stopping 5 minutes in the morning and 3 cars stopping 1 minute later than the morning cars#

 Let J be the number of cups that Herman needs.Then the first month he needs 45 * 2 = 90 cups of food.  So J = 90.Remembering the second month is half of the first one, he also needs 45 * 2 = 90 cups of food. The third month, he needs one less cup of food, which takes him to another 45 * 2 = 45 cups. The sum of K, J, and P is: K + J + P = (10 + 1 + 1) * 45 = 2970 cups of food overall.The answer is 2970 cups.question: The Holidays roll around again and Karen schedules Lee to work even creative hours.  Karen schedules her other employees to work - 7 hours#

 From the expression, the minimum appears to be 120.  Therefore his consumption will be 120/120/20 = 4 cups from December to February.This will be the responsibility of his sister Alma.She will have to eat 4*120/20 = 36 cups from each day.They can only afford 36 combinations.So she will have to eat an average of 6 cups (3 meals of 6) per week.How many weeks will Herman need?Eating 4 cups on two days in a week, and two meals of 6 each day will require him to bring home 5 different foods twice. So he will need a total of 2 weeks of meals out of 2 different foods, 3 meals out of one food and 5 days out of another food.Thus a#

 Since he feeds them approximately the same amount in the morning and afternoon, only B, the number of days Herman feeds the birds, matters.  If B = 15, then he needs 29 cups of food for the winter.If B = 10, then he needs 14 cups of food for the winter.B = 4, 548 to feed the birds.Then substituting 8 for B gives 8 x 4, 548 = 32, 672.Then 8 x 4, 548/8 = 4, 548.The answer is 4, 548.question: Margo is playing a match.

 In the morning and afternoon, Herman would need 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 cup per day (daily).  Herman would need to feed the birds 2 cups in the month of December, 4 cups in March, 5 cups in February and 3 cups in January.The answer is 40.question: Ralph has 12 identical marks, 3 extra marks, and 6 hidden marks.He hides 3 marked marks from himself and 3 hidden marks from Clara.He doesn't think Clara knows how many marks Ralph has in total.He#

 Let x be the number of cups of food for all three months.and let k be the number of cups that Herman feeds in the morning.Then x=x+k.To simplify,   72 / 24 x, let 
42 / 24 x / 3 unnecessary subtract from both sides by combining terms and simplify 3 / 24 = 12.So we get x = 7 + 12, which is the right number.The answer is 7 + 12 = 15.question: Micky wants to play baseball.  He#

 Nothing. He feeds the birds the same amount of food every month.Therefore, he needs no additional cups of food for the three months. The answer is 3.question: Samuel is obtaining $64,000 of savings. If he pays off two#

 Herman enjoys feeding the birds in December and January. Let's call them E, F and G respectively. Let x be the number of cups of food in total.  Then E*x + F*x + G*x = 112.Adding constants produces 112 - E - F - G = 87.50.Dividing the expressions by the largest term produces E^x / (E + F + G) = (1/2)(1/2^2) / (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2) = 1/3.Therefore, x = 450 cups of food.In alternative 2: The expressions simplifies to 3-1/2x / 52 - 1 = 0.75.Multiply by 0.75 to get x = 450 cups of food.This indicates that Herman owes the birds#

 Let the number of times he feeds the birds be c. He has to feed them each week so the number of times he feeds the birds over the 3-weeks is c*7.Thus, he needs to feed the birds 10 * c*7 = 40 cups.The number of times he feeds the birds each day equals med = (7 * c)/10 and therefore, he would need 1 * med*7 = 11 days to finish all the work. He would therefore need the number of days to complete all the work multiplied by 7 = 77 days to complete it.The answer is 77.question: The number of people who walk to the bus stops is the product of the number of bright colored posters and the number of#

 The food will be 1/2 cup in each month so the number of cups would be 15 = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2.He gives the same amount of food in each months so the number of cups of food given in each month would be:/15=2.Then, the number of cups given would be 2 x 15 = 30 cups of food.The answer is 30.question: Karla has 16 koolaid cans and 10 pudding cups.

 The number of cups he will need is 10 + 5 + 1 = 20.Question 2An airliner flew over the plains of North America at a speed of 400 mph.  At this speed, the specific gravity of oil is 1.08 g/cc.  How far did the oil spread from the wall?answer: Sarah specialized in solving complex equations. We can use the following method to find the solution: Factor the oil in each month, because only one factor is common.The number of cells in#

 Let m be the number of cups.Therefore, we have 50 - m - 26 = 1So m + 26 = 49.Combining terms results in (m -2) + (m + 26) = 1.Therefore B = (m -2) + 50 - m - 26 = 49 - 26 = 23.Converting to degrees gives 90° - (90° - (m - 2) + 50° - m) = 2m6 The answer is 2m6.question: Numbers share#

 Let E be the number of cups of food that he needs.  Then the morning and afternoon math should add up to 3 cups.The total will be E + 4*E = 6 cups.Thus, the equation is 6x + 3x = 1+1+1 = 3, which can be simplified to 1x + 3x = 1 since x is multiplied by 1 on both sides of the equation.Therefore, the number of cups will be 1 + 3 = 4.Therefore, Herman will need 4 cups of food for all three months.The answer is 4.question: Sometimes Grace likes to buy dinner at the restaurant, but sometimes not.

 Herman's averaging days of food are 30, the number of days in a month.  At noon on the 31st day of each month, DD su z is 1340, the number of cups of food he needs.  Therefore, at noon on the 31st day of the second month, DD s his z needs Or  -30 cups of food in total. There will be 292 days in his three-month feeding schedule.  Buffy will steal 24 cups of food -- i.e. 2.2% of Fuller's cups. Therefore, 22% of Henley's food should be infested with bugs on or before the 13th day of the third month, or on Jan. 17th.In case you forgot, Doverberry will not enjoy her fresh flower bulb#

 Let's first do one month.  Since Herman was feeding, 1/2 cup at the morning and the afternoon, 2 * 1/2 = 1/4 cup.   The amount of food he needed for that month was 1/4 * 12 = 2.25 cups of food.   So his total amount of food needed for the month was 2.25 * 3 = 6.75 cups of food.  We need to multiply that by 365 days so that we get the total amount of food Herman needs to eat every year. The answer is 6.75*33 = 285 cups of food per year, which is less than (6.75 * 7.5 = 147) cups of food per week, which is less than (6.75 * 10 = 70) cups of food per#

 Let S be the total number of cups his birds need, and N be the number of meals he feeds them.Then the number of cups in January is the same as the number in February, so N is equal to N = 1.From Peter patents, he can know that the number of meals in December is the same as the number in March. So N will be the same as N.So N will be N = 1.This means that S = 102/3 = 25 cups of food.So Herman will need 25 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total is 75 cups of food. The answer is 75.question: Steven started a project on March 7. He measured the remaining part of the ball labeled A#

 Let D be the number of cups of food that Herman needed for all three months. Then 2*D = 3/2*D + 1/2*D = 3/2*(2*D + 1/2*D)1/2/(2*D + 1/2*D)1/2 + 1/2*D = 8*D + 8*D + 4*D = 296.We know that Herman feeds a total of 8 cups of food in three months so the answer is 8.question: -k cups of milk is jarred in#
