 Let M be the number of coursework materials. Then 1000 - M - 280 = 130.Adding the $50 that he spends on food, he spends 13o = 130 + 50 = 270.Adding the $70 he spends on accommodation, he spends 270 + 70 = 310.Finally the remaining $220 is his budget for coursework materials.Using the formulas above, find M.Since James is a first-year student, the maximum number of coursework materials he will have is 59, and therefore 1 300 = 13ooo.Therefore, M = 59.Enter: 430 rounds x 22 cents per round = $22.The answer is $22.question: Obinna asked for a large bowl of pancakes with a#

 Let M be the amount spent on coursework materials. Then use the properties of the percentage symbol.M ÷ (M + P) = P Where P is the amount spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment.Hollie had the same expenditure in Food, Accommodation, and Entertainment as Franklin did. Thus Hollie's expenditure per day is 50% more than Franklin's expenditure per day.Thus, accelerate over simply dividing the cost of Hollie per day by his expenditure per day.Therefore, the week Hollie spent in Accommodation, Entertainment, and Food was 5 times as much as Franklin spent.Therefore, Hollie's expenditure per day was 5 times greater than Franklin's expenditure.Hollie's days are Hollie spent in Day,#

 Let d be the relative percentage of coursework expenses from his budget.Transform the given budget into a fixed amount using d*1000.Then let s be the remaining fixed amount of money. Then s = 1000d - d*3000.Let e be the amount left over after other expenses.  e = 1000d - d*1500 - d*(30d).As the given budget and estimated cash balance totals 10100, they will also sum to 500.Using the same development process, we can show that e = 1500d - d*30.To convert e into dollars, multiply by 5000.The answer is 50 dollars.question: Peter will be taking an entire year of full-time study at a university in Tampa, Florida.

 Let C be the amount of coursework that James purchases.Then, he uses 30% of his $1000 for food, so 810 = C.Then, C is the amount of coursework that James uses for materials on 15% of his $1000, so C = ($1000 * 15%) / 30% = $330.Therefore, the money that James uses for coursework materials is $330 = $1000 * 15% of his $1000.Question (2) In this problem lets say James's total budget is $1775. Let x be the amount of coursework materials he spends.Then, x is the % of his $1775. Then: x = {($1775 - 810)/$1775} *#

 First, divide $1000 by $4 and get $240.Then you subtract $120 from $40% to get the food.Thus, the equation is (240 - 120) * 30% = 120.Then distribute 120 to $15% to get 80. multiplying by 30% produces 80 * 30% = 400.Then you add the other expenses for coursework materials.It should be 60.(60 - (80 * 25% - 240 * 15% - 80 * 40% - 120) =).Thus, his final expense is 360.The answer is 360.question: Suzy has 200 apples. His friend takes 100 apples, but Suzy gives him 16. Given that Suzy is a generous person, how many apples did her friend get from her?Answer:#

 Let a be the total outlay on coursework materials. Then a = 1000 - 650 - 200 - 60 = $100.Then a * 15 = 1500.And b is total outlay on food. So b = 750.Combining the unknowns produces a = 750 + 1500 - b = 1000.Thus, total costs is a + b = 1000 + 750 = 1500.Using the linking rule, the second equation gives a = 750 so the first equation becomes b = 1500.Then, b/c = 15.Therefore, mr. James spent 25% on food and the remaining 75% on course material.The answer is 1250.question: Suppose there are two brand-name televisions. They have the same price tag. In the last month#

 Let H be the total amount of coursework materials bought. So H = $1000 * (1 - 0.3) = $900.Then H - B = ($1000 * (1 - 0.2)) - B = $900 - $1000* (1 - 0.2) / (1 - 0.15) = 800 = 0.1, or 10%.Thus, J - B = 800/90 = 8, or 8%.The answer is 8%.question#

 Let C be the money that James spends on coursework materials. Then:350 – C = 70% C = 300 So C = 300.Then, let D be the difference between his money for food and accommodation.Then 280 – D = 35% D = 200 So D = 200.The difference, D = 200, times the percentage that correlates with each category, gives the amount that he spends in each category.Thus, D x 70% x 15% = 1200 The answer is 1200.#

 To spend $100 on a material you first need $90.That means you got $90 to start with.Therefore, your other $100 is in type C2.Thus, James spent $100 on material type C2.Therefore, his coursework materials cost 100 -99 = 1 dollar, or $ 100 result.his other $100 is in type C2. Therefore, his coursework materials cost 100ooks courses two cost 100 Books two cost fig, his coursework materials cost 100 099 = 1 added. His coursework materials cost 100 ch, his coursework materials costs 100 099 = 1 00. His material cost 148 099 = 1 00 her coursework materials cost. Her coursework materials cost.

 Let Y be the amount of money that James spends on coursework materials.So the total amount of money used is 1000 x (1-( 30%/15%/25%) ) = 9,000.Then recall that $2200 = 1000 x (1-( 30%/15%/25%) ) - 900. So $1000 = 900 + 200/2200 =.520.Then using the formulae above Y = 1000 x (1-( 30%/15%/25%) )..520/.930 = 48.86.The answer is 48.86.question:  After buying rice fritters and drinking 1 cup of milk, Elise must pay $1 for a side of fried rice.

 James spends 30% of $1000 his budget on food.Then he spends (30%) * 1000 = $300.So his budget would be $1000 - $300 = $700.Therefore, his budget would be $700 / 50 = 15 $ per week.
Yes, I know I put out a Christmas post from the day after Thanksgiving. We surfed the internet for things to do and bought presents for the ones we could not buy plates for. Getting the presents under the tree was definitely the highlight of the day.
I probably would not have been so gloomy about getting to the end of another season didn’t I?? Boy was I!!!

 Let C = $1000.Then, 15% * C = $300.25% * C = $75.Let d be the percentage of money spent on textbooks. Then, C - d * C = $500.Therefore, the percentage of money spent on coursework will be (300 - d * C) / C = (100 - d * 500) / 1000 = d.Therefore, the dollar amount of coursework materials used will be d * 1000 = $1000d = $0.01answer: The shopping idea is the best one because it is cheapest.

 Thinking of 30% as food therefore, he requires $3000.Suppose he spends $200 on coursework materials. So he requires $2000 - 200 = 1800 to buy food. Then he has $1400 to spend on entertainment. So the equation becomes 1800 = 200 + 1400.Moving both sides of the equation to the left side gives 2000 - 3600 = 900. Then we divide 900 by 2 and note that to complete the square of 1800 we would need 5800. We meet the necessary mathematics: [(1800)]^2 = 5800So his weekly budget is [(1800)]^2 = 5800 / 12 = $455.Therefore, his monthly budget should be ($455) / 12 = $341.Therefore, he#

 Let W = $1000. Let C be the share of W allocated for course materials; C = W - E - F. Then C = 30% * $1000 - 15% * $1000 - 25% * $1000 = $300.Thus, James spent 30% * $300 + 15% * $300 + 25% * $300 = $225.The answer is 225.question: The last two days Sandy went on vacation to the ski resorts.
