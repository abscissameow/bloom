 Let x be the number of books that Krystian borrowed per day.Then the number of books in a week is ∫ x.dx=1.5*7 = 15.The library is open from Monday to Friday so the timespan is: Monday – Friday, omitted? Let t = 5.tday * 5 = (6/day-1)* 5= ∫ 5-∑ 5 = 2*5 = 10.The number of books in a week is 10 + 5.5 = 15.The number of books that Krystian borrowed in a week is 15 - 1.5 = 14.The answer is 14.chapter 7简单分式 pertiquesntuation problem A contractor is sure that his company will make the correct prices#

 Let B be the number of books borrowed in a week.Let D be the daily average.Let W be the week.Then B = 40 x W/DSo, we have B = 40 x W/D - 40 = 200200/400 = 1/2Thus, in a day, Krystian borrows 40 books.Since the library is open Monday through Friday, the number that he wants to calculate is the number of books he takes in a week.To find it, deduct B from 200. Thus, 47 = 200 - B.And don't forget to divide it by 7.azole/7 = 6.25, which is the average number of days in a week. In a week, he takes 6.25 times his daily average#

 Let x be the average number of books that Krystian borrows every day. Then since the library runs Mondays through Fridays, we have x + 2(x + 1) = 55.Distributing 55 to x + 1 yields 2(x + 1) = 54.Then from 2(x + 1) = 55, we have 55/2 = 25.Therefore, x = 25. But to compute the number of books Krystian practices in a week, we need x + 30 × 5 = 385.Since we have x = 25, we have: x + 30 × 5 = 385 {\displaystyle x+30\times 5=385}.Then x + 30 ( 25 ) = 385 {\displaystyle x+30\times {25}=380}.Therefore, the number of books that Krystian borrows in a week would be 2 × ( 385 ) = 800 {\displaystyle 2\times (385)=800}.The answer is 800.question: A lawyer files a laws#

 When Krystian is working, he usually record in his paper keepsake the total number of books borrowed every day. After the school is out he checks the regular paper. Then he subtracts the average number of books he borrowed in school from the total borrowed during the summer recess.He then multiplies the result by 6/5 = 1.2.The answer is 1.2M.In conclusion, the following theorems are true:Sum of the product of the odd integers: Sum of the#

 Let H be the number of books Krystian borrows in a week.Then the number of books he borrowed on Monday is 40B + 30H = 40 + 30 * (40 + 10) = 60 books in a week, where B is the average borrowing per day.On the average, Krystian borrows 40 books per day and in one week he borrows 60 books.Therefore, the number of books that he borrowed in one week will be: 60 * 4.

 Let B be the number of books that Krystian borrows. Then 40B - 8 = 42.ாங் 8B = 40So the week average is 40 - 8 - 8 = 32.Therefore, Krystian borrows 32Books in a week.The answer is 32.question: Let G be the number of girls that Carla borrows.

 Let x be the number of books that Krystian borrows everyday.Then 45+40*x = (40+100)*x.Then 45+40/100*x = (40+x)/100.Then 45+40*x*100 = 30*x + 40*x.Then 30*x + 40*x + 40 = 0.Combining x terms and times 100 gives 30 x 1 + 40 x 100 < 0.Which has solution x3 < 8.Then 3x < 4.Therefore Krystian borrows no more than 8 books in a week.The answer is 8.toString(:ikoanum)Lap1-original#0; Name=\"Krbasoin\"Sutan={:is = AssignmentLog; :value = 12 apabila ada 3#

 Let E be the number of books that Krystian borrowes in one week.Then E/B is the number of books that he borrows on a given week.Because our interest is in a weekly average, we have 43/139 = 2.Then E/B = 2 x 43/139 x 1/40 = 16 books.The answer is 16.question: Group of 5 boys met in the park to have a picnic.

 Let x be the number of books that Krystian normally shelves in the library in a day.Then 25/(x + 1) = (x + 1)/10But in a week, we normally do 1/12 of work in a day.That is, x = 1/12 * 40 = 5 books.Let B be the number of books that get out of Krystian's "honey bucket" (borrowed manually) in a week.Then B = 40 * 0.4 = 2 books.I'd like to thank Xmanualonline for providing answers to questions but there is no way to Top their questions and their answers They get all credits.

 Let H be the number of books that Krystian borrow in a week.  To know oral-harry has the formula (H +14) / 14.The average number of books the library is open per day is about 40.Thus, you have a formula of H + 40 / 14.With these, we see that Krystian would take H = (H + 40 / 14) / 14 = 473 / 14 = 19.89 books.The library is not open on the weekends so the optimum would be 19.89 - 4 / 14 days = 16.9 books.The answer is 16.9 books. question (2): Ellie spends an average of $16 for a lunch.

 The number of books that Krystian borrows in a week is 40 x 6/12 = 30.The week between Monday and Friday is 6 Sundays, so 6 * 30 = 180 books.That is 180 + 40 = 260 books.The number of books that Krystian borrows in a week is: 260 + 40 = 280.The answer is 280.question: Paco drove one kilometer every 2.5 minutes from 3 hours past 7 p.m. to 12:00 noon.

 Krystian borrows an average of 40 * 22 = 800 books per week. Every Friday he borrows 40 + 440, or 40.1% higher than the daily average. Therefore, there are 4460 books on Thursday. Then 22 * 4460 = 55.87 books per week.So, the number of books Krystian borrowed on Friday is 2 * 55.87 = 87.So, Krystian borrowed 87 every Friday.The answer is 87.question: After Paul checks#

 Let B be the number of borrowings. B will be 57 in this situation.We can express B as B = 40 + 7 x 3/10 obtaining 7 "borrowings".Subtract B from 55 but this time using $\mathbb{Q}$.Now, B will be 55 - 7 x 3/10 = 42.Add 2 to B and you will be left with 42 + 6 = 46.Then add 3 to B and you will be left with 47.Therefore, the number of books that he usually borrows is raised to the $V_0^+_3/10 = \overline{4}$th power.The answer is 46.question: A fire began in a cellar and no one could hear it.

 Let x be the number of books Krystian borrows in a week.The first day he borrows 40 books.Let k be the number of books he borrows on the second day.Let s be s = x - k. Then 80 - (s + k) = 64 + 60 = 120.The total number of books he borrows for a week would be 120.
Over the course of a week, up to 8 books can be borrowed so the Following equations apply.Thus the total number of borrowed books over the course of a week would be 120 + 40 +..... + 40 = 240 books.The answer is 240 books and hence cut was 40%.question: The number of phones sold to students who are 14 by Jessica#

 Let B be the number of books that Krystian borrowed in a week. The solution to B*10/12 + B*8/36 +... = B*100/128 is the first target B*10/12 = 500. Thus, the homework is to find all possible target values of B and solve for the corresponding values of B.So we are looking for all squares of target values of B.B is to be a square.So, we have the following.Next, partition the lefthand side as follows:50/100 + 1/4 + 1/10000Next, subtract 50 from both sides, and divide through by 25: 125*(9/5 - 1/2)/36 = 500Next, divide through by {5,3,2,1#
