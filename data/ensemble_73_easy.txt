 Let x be number of packs needed for trail mix. Since Roger is helping the band players, he needed 2 sets of 6 packs.Therefore, he will need 36 x 6 = 216 packs of trail mix.Then, X needs to account for the number of members of the baseball team, which is * 6 = 60.Then there are coaching and administrative staff, which is * 4 = 24.The total for everyone is = 216 + 60 + 24 = 346.To make a new trailer of x trailers now, x balls are needed. Thus, he needs 346 / x = 432 x balls.</s>Q:
