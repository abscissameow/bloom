 Let X be the amount of babysitting that she has.Then, 50 minutes = X/5.Therefore, X = 5 * 12 = 60.Then, 5X = 60.Therefore, the amount that she earned is 5X = 60.The answer is 60.It is very helpful if you study the the five common types of problems and ideas that appear in word problems Annualizable such as giving units or credits, calculating ratios and proportions, finding to solving applications/use - examples in#

 Since she did a 50-minute shift yesterday, her previous week's income was $50. Her hourly wage is $12. Thus, in today's hour, she earned (50/12) x 1.5 = $8.25.Then Yesterday she earned $12 + (48/12) x 1.5 = $18.25 = $47.25 total. Her typical week is $50 / 7 = $47.25.Therefore, the number of hours of babysitting she did yesterday was 4.5.The answer is 4.5.I can help you. Just send me a message."Eilif".

 So, let x be the number of minutes Weng babysit.Let S be the salary and let JV = x*S be the value per minutes.Then, Weng earned x*S + (10*S)*h = 12*S + 10*S*h = S*(6/5) + S*(4/5) = 1/2 S*h.And Weng did 50 minutes of babysitting for 1/2 S*h = 25*S = 250*S = 2500*S = $25.The answer is $25.question: Every ant was given a flower piece to collect. On average, 30 ants collected in 15 minutes. The total number of ants that collected in 30 minutes was 5.25 times as many ant#

 Let w be the amount of money, in dollars for babysitting.Then, w = 12 x 50/60 = 18 dollars, because it is an hour's work.Therefore, y = 18 * x = 36 dollars.Let y = y * 30 because we are dividing by 30 costs. 1 = y*30/2. Thus, s = y/2 = 9.5.Therefore, she earned s * 12 = 18 x 30/2 = 18 x (15 + 4)/2 = 105 dollars. The answer is 105.

 Let w be the amount of babysitting that Weng did. Then w = 50 minutes x $8 = $400.There are times where it takes longer than 50 minutes to do the work. In this case, let's say that it was 60 minutes. Then w = 50 minutes x $8 = $400 = $600.So she earned $600.Now, what is her pay for yesterday? Let P be the amount that she earned for yesterday. Then w + P = $600 + $400 = $800.Thus, Weng earned $800 for the babysitting.The answer is $800.question: In the statistics quiz, the first question was the newest and the last question was the oldest! The first question was#

 Let x be the total hours worked yesterday and let a be the hourly pay.50 x 
12 an hour = 5000 php (PHP = Philippine peso).Then make it simpler: 5 x 25 =
1000.The total pay = 7000 php (since 1000 is the midpoint between 5000 and 
12).Thus the answer is 7000 php.This is the end of our collection.It's about time to relax! Aside from this, you can also check our other Math Exercises.Also#

 Let x be the number we should be counting and w be the number of minutes that they cost.So, the number of minutes she cost was 50 + w minutes.Then the number of minutes she earned would be x + 50 = x + w = 50 + w.Bracketing the first 50 on the left side and the 50 on the right side gives us x + w = (50 + w)(50 + w - x).Then divide both sides by 50, giving us x = (50 + w)-50/50 = w/50.When we multiply the answer by twelve, they equal to what we ultimately had x = w * 12, and then we get the answer we wanted: w = 12 * 50/60 = 60 minutes#

 Let x = the minutes of babysitting. Then x = 50. Let t = the dollar less for her bringing supplies. Then t = 12. Thus the expression becomes x = $50 - 12 = 42.And the value of x = 10 minutes.The answer is 10.question: Frank has a suitcase and a backpack. He put his backpack in the suitcase.

 Let W be the amount of money that we want to find. Then let N be the number of minutes spent babysitting.Then W = 12*50/60 = $12.Therefore, the total hourly earnings would be N * W/60 = 50 * 12/60 = 10.5.The answer is 10.5.

 Weng earned 50 x $12 = $600.And yesterday she did 50 minutes or 500 seconds of babysitting = 500.Multiplying gives Weng $12 * 500 = $6000.The $600 is just part of her earnings. amount earned and how many minutes or seconds are used in babysitting.The final amount is given 150 seconds* $12 = $1800.An hour's work is 24 hours O(1).It is also apparent that to gain 150 seconds a time is just divided (ie not multiplied) by 150.Thus, the time to do A for B is B/A disambiguation hours, not minutes.question: When preposed to a word, the plus sign becomes a lowercase letter.

 Let E be the number of minutes that she did.Then 50 x $10 = $500.So E = (500 - 12)/100 = 400.The Answer is 400.question: Nick finished a standard practice set of 5 minutes on his 12th#

 Let Y be the in an hour. Then Y / 50 = 2.Absolute value is 3 and subtract one from that.Therefore she earned -12 + 3 + 1 = -8 per hour.The answer is -8.QUESTION 6 question 1: A hundred#
