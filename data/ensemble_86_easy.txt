 Let y be the grams of soda that Peter bought. Then the grams divided by the amount of dollars equals to 1 ounce. We can represent it by 1/y.Then, x is the number of dollars, so it can be represented by x/y.Since they are fractions, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, so x/y = (x+y)/y.Multiply y and x to both sides and distribute the y to the numerator and denominator: x/y = (y)/(x + y) = (y)/y = (1/y)/y = (1/(1 + y))/y = 377/y = 377/(1 + y) = 377/(1 + 2) = 258.Therefore, Peter bought y = 2 ounces of soda.
