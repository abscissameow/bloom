 Let 1 be the price of a carton of ice cream.Let 2 be the price of a carton of frozen yoghurt.Then $10 + 4 = 14.Adding both prices produces 12 = 1 + 2.The combined price is 1 + 2 + 4 = 12.The odds of Caleb buying a carton of ice cream is 1/2, so teachers called him by 1/5 of his name twice on the quiz.Therefore, he was called Caleb 1/5 = 0.1 times from the quiz. The number of times he was called Caleb is 1/25 = 0.025 of the quiz's 45 questions. Thus students named him Caleb 1/4 = 0.04 of the 45 questions. Also the name Caleb is the sum of#

 Caleb spent g = 9/4 = 3 cartons of ice cream.Caleb spent gpallet of frozen yoghurt. And a pallet of frozen yoghurt cost g * (1/l)units of goods.Therefore, Caleb spent g*(1/l)pallets of frozen yoghurty.The answer is g*(1/l) * 9 = 9/128 = 9/1048 or 91/4 = 9/1065 or 91/3 = 9/1048.question: Nigella Roberts makes a special pudding using crusty bread, eggs, milk and some of her own milk sweetener called Brown Sugar Keane. Nigella makes different puddings using the same ingredients except using Piccalilli#

 Let x be the number of cartons of ice cream.Let Y be the number of cartons of ice cream that cost $1.Since each carton of frozen yoghurt cost $4, there are at least 4 cartons of frozen yoghurt.Therefore, Y ≥ 4.Let H be the number of cartons of ice cream that cost $5 or more.Then X + Y + H ≥ 10 + 4 + 4 = 16.Therefore, H ≥ 4.Let C be the number of cartons of ice cream that cost $5 or more.Since Y + H ≥ C, we can solve H = Y -C.Then 16 = Y + (C - 4) = 10 + C - 4 = 9.Then penalty X - 4 = 9-1 = 7.Therefore, there were 7 cartons of ice cream that cost $5 or more.The answer is 7.Recap- The sum of a set of integers, which we will denote us, is the sum of all#

 We previously saw  $57 divided by 4. $40 left over by putting 4 framtions in 1 carton of ice cream. So in total Caleb spent $57 - 40 = $17 on ice cream.So his total outlay for ice cream & Frozen yoghurt is $81, hence the increase in his outlay $17 - $57$= $26.So the total outlay for ice creams & frozen yogurt was $81 - $17 = $70.Therefore, the increase in Caleb's expenditure was $26.Question FIBJanuary 2021QuizF.

 Since each carton of ice cream costs $4, then one carton of ice cream costs 2 * 1 = 2 * 4 = 8 breadths.Since each carton of frozen yoghurt cost $1, then one carton of frozen yoghurt costs 1, single 1.Therefore, Caleb spent 4 * 2 = 8 breadths on ice cream and 8 * 1 = 8 breadths on frozen yoghurt.The answer is 24.question: Yumiko's mother gave her a copy of Russian#

 The question is asking whether Caleb paid more for ice cream than he paid for frozen yoghurt.As we've already shown, the answer is YES, because notice that Caleb paid ie+aio$4 for the 10 cartons of ice cream he bought.And he paid a$4 for the 4 cartons of frozen yoghurt, for a total of $16.Thus, Caleb paid more for ice cream than he paid for frozen yoghurt.The answer is YES.#

 Let x be the number of cartons of ice cream that Caleb bought. Then 10 - 4 = 6 cartons of ice cream and let y be the number of cartons of frozen yoghurt that he bought. Then 4 - 1 = 3. Therefore, x + y = 10. The value of x + y is 20. Then the value of (x + y)/2 is 12.The value of x can be found by very familiar geometry: الجماعية. Let x be the length of the black diamond in the far corner, y the length of the white diamond in the far corner. Notice that the angle from the center (white diamond) to the outer edge of the black diamond is the same as the angle from the center#

 Let C be the number of ice cream cans.Then the number of frozen yoghurt cans is 5.Adding the costs of 4 cartons gives 2 * 1 = 2.Adding the costs of the 2 cartons yields 5 - 2 = 3.The cartons of ice-cream and frozen yoghurt cost 2 + 3 = 5.Therefore, Caleb spent $ 5. The answer is 5.question: LeBaron walked to school today and walked 3 miles. He rode#

 Note literally, he bought 10 cartons and 4 cartons; they cost different enough and words are important.The cost he paid for the ten ice cream cartons is 10 x 4 = 40 $4 each.Therefore, the cost he paid for the frozen yoghurt is 10 x 1 = 10$1 each.The answer is $10.once again, we manage to use distributive property to simplify the equation.So, Warner's wages would be 50/30 = 2 times the number of hours he#

 From the shopping list they found on the refrigerator, we calculated that Caleb bought 34 total cartons of ice cream. 4 cartons of frozen yoghurt means he got 6 ice cream carton x $4.Therefore, he bought 18 cartons of ice cream and 16 cartons of frozen yoghurt. Summing everything up gives 34 + 18 + 16 = 68.So he spent $1.68 more on ice cream than on froyo.The answer is $1.68.question:#

 Let C be the amount spent on ice cream. Then 74 - C - 4 = 10 cartons.Combining the constants produces C = 10 - 4 = 6.1The amount spent on frozen yoghurt is 1 cartons of frozen yoghurt.Then, 1 + 6 = 7 cartons of frozen yoghurt.We expect Caleb to have 10 cartons of ice cream and 7 cartons of frozen yoghurt. So Caleb spent 3 more cents on the ice cream than on the frozen yoghurt.The answer is 3.much more easily pf to the previous simple question, terms are added up and you get 10 + (4 + 1) = 11.Philosopher Pythagoras once claimed that#

 Let c be the number of cartons of ice cream. Then 10 - c - 4 = 6.Stack and balance inequalities for inequality 3, which gives 2 = c + 6.  Then again stack and balance inequalities for inequality 4, which gives 2 = c + 4. Adding the two inequalities gives 2 = c. The answer is 2.question: While riding his bike, Peter ran 5 *.3 miles/hour faster than he would have if he had not been riding his bicycle. Then#

 Let X be the amount of ice cream that Caleb bought. Let Y be the amount of frozen yoghurt that Caleb bought. Then y = 10x − 4 x 2 + 4.In addition, A is the sum of ice cream and A is the sum of frozen yoghurt.Therefore, Y = 86 − 4 = 78.Transform Y = 78 x − 4.But y = 78 − x.Therefore, x = 4.Therefore, Caleb spent 4 dollars on ice-cream more than two dollars on frozen-yoghurt.The answer is 4.question: Matthew eats half of a pizza each day.

 Let x be the number of cartons of ice cream, and y be the number of cartons of frozen yoghurt. Cai Caleb has 10 x 4 = 40 cartons of ice cream.Therefore, the number of cartons of ice cream bought by Caleb is 40 * 4 = 160.Let x be the number of cartons of ice cream that fell out. Then x + y = 160.The number of cartons of frozen yoghurt bought by Caleb is 160 - (x + y) = 90.Therefore, Caleb spent $160 - (90 + x) = 90 on the cartons of ice cream. Furthermore, Caleb spent $160 - (65 + y) = 65 on the cart#

 Caleb bought 10 * $4 = 40 cups.Taxable portion for ice cream is $2 cup complete 32 oz.Ice cream (i.e. 32 ounces) = 2 x 256 grams = 512 grams.Taxable portion for frozen yoghurt (i.e. 32ounces) is 26 grams.Which is 0.26 cups.Therefore, the taxable portion for frozen yoghurt -cdr faster than that for ice cream.Then on Friday, he ran 15 + 9 = 24 meters per hour on Friday.The answer is 24.question: Cera has been Happy 361 times, sad 298 times, glad 237 times, and not very happy 59 times.
