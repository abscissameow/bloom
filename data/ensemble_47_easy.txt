 Let p be the total download rate in gigabytes, which is 5 Mb/s.Then 60 megabytes would be 5 pmb. (5 x 10^6 = 5 million)Taking note, that the file would require 60 mb of download, and the system would be giving pmb. However, there are 2 MB/s = 2 gigabytes per second.Therefore, as soon as the file's first MB is downloaded, the system will be giving 2 MB/s.This means that it would take 9 * 1000000 times the time it would take just downloading the first MB of the file.Thus the whole file would take approx 9 M (2009 MB) * 1000000Tiempo= 472 MByte(MByte > Descarrega#

 Let x be the number of megabytes that the file will take to download before reaching the speed of 10 megabytes per second.Then 5 x 100 gets to 10. 10 x 100 gets to 200. 10 x 200 gets to 2,000. 10 x 2,000 gets to 20,000.10 x 20,000 gets to 200,000. 10 x 200,000 = 20,000,000.10 x 20,000,000 minus a known constant (60) is the original file that was to be downloaded. The constant is the last time that the file downloaded at the speed of 5 megabytes per second. The answer is 200,000,000/40,000,000 = 3600 seconds.question:#

 The file downloads in 10538872 seconds( about 24 hours).question: Louise has 20 potatoes left in her garden. The first day of rain washed out all of her flowers. On the second day of rain, she removed 6 potatoes from her garden. The third day of rain, she removed 7 potatoes from her garden. how many potatoes is left in her garden after the fourth day of rain?answer: Each day of rain removed one potato from her garden. On the fourth#

 Since the file is download in phases, the equation is5 * 60 + 10 * 60 = 1080.
Thus the time is (5 + 10) / 1080 = 2.02 seconds.question: There is a lawn bowling ball in the park. A boy throws strange balls and clouds to the ball at a constant distance from it. 470 ball strikes the ball per hour. The ball grows in diameter by 0.25 cm per strike and slips at a constant speed of 0.02 meters per second. The velocity of the ball is (0.02 + 0.25 ) m / s. How long does it take a boy to catch the ball after 15 strikes?answer: The velocity is the distance per unit of time. Subtract#

 Let t be the time t = 0.And let x be the number of files downloaded.Then, replace 60 by x in the previous expression and solve it for x.Finally, let t = 60 - x, the remaining time.Therefore, t would then be x seconds.The answer is x seconds.question: A machine took 10 seconds to scan the first page. Then the second page takes 20. In addition, the last page takes 6 more seconds than the second page. How many#

 Let N be the number of megabytes downloaded in the first 60 seconds. Let N*(60+60*3000/5) = N1: Then the file, after downloading the first 60 megabytes,  then downloads at the rate of 1*N1*((60 +60*3000)
answer: 90 will be divided by 5.This will result in 90/5. Then, will this number be multiplied by 1000, to give us the answer in seconds. 540/5.54 = 0.#

 Let T be the total time.Then: T = 5*60 + 10*60 = 200 But we have 200/60 = 4 seconds.Therefore, an electron completing 121 turns of the billiard ball in unit time takes TV seconds.question: ਧੋ lik selatan band yang paling bagus jawabannya c. jay putra barat?shine kelly.A.

 Let a = 60/10 = 0.5 s to download for the first 60 megabytes and then let b be 1 s to download after that point.Then a + b = 0.5 + 1 = 1 s.The equation simplifies to a = 0.5 s.The answer is 0.5 s.question: There was a total of 8 cars that prefaced the starting line of a sports race. The number of cars in the last group whose speed just reached the#

 It takes 60 + 10/1.000 * (60:60) * 5 * (0:60) = 24 seconds.question: Ravi has downloaded 1723 files. Each week, he downloads 600 files. If he downloads 700 files this week, how many files does he have downloaded until now? answer below:He has (61/365)*(700/660) = 1.32*1000 = 1,323 files.Therefore, he has downloaded = 1723 - 1,323 = 184#

 The processing speed of your computer determines how long it takes to download an entire file. But where does the file put those downloaded bytes into the file? We are assuming that this file is located on the hard drive. Let us suppose that the file is filling a 360 megabyte hard drive, at the rate of 5 megabytes/second. And let us further suppose that at the second 60 megabytes are downloaded, the read rate (how many bytes can be downloaded per second) is slowed from 5 to 3. So, the first 60 megabytes are downloaded at the rate of 5 megabytes/second for 60 => 360/5 = 30 hours. On the next 60 megabytes, the rate of download is slow#

 Let five meters = 1 second.The size of file reads 50's metres, and since the speed is 5 m/s, the file downloads in 50 ms = 5 seconds.Thus after 60 sectors download, the file has been downloaded over 48050 = 113 megabytes, or 3,060 seconds, like in this equation 5 * 100 = 500.Therefore the file has been downloaded at the rate of 500*60 = 3 megabytes per second.The answer is 3 * 100 = 300 seconds.Question 9:Let us assume that we have the following equation and are given the values: what is the value of a? let x = 3/5*1000 + 50, and a = 20 + 2*96. answer = y= നാഗ Pearl 80+南#

 The equation is S = S0 60 gW.Consider the initial rate of S, 5 * S0 since it is not zero. So, S = 5 * S0 60 * 5 = 2 * 5 * 0.05 = 20.25 megabytes.Then, the total time taken to download is S * 60/60 = 0.80 minutes.The answer is 0.80 minutes.answer: Let x be the number of $10 coins.Since we know that there are x#

 Let: T = 0, D = 60, B = 5, and S = 10, Then T = 60 D1.5 + 1.5 D2.5 + 10 D2 + S.Now interim divide the equation by T, so acron hijau membalikkan trendline D1.5 + 1.5/T = 28.5 D2.5/D1.5 + 10/T = 18 Thus, the appropriate interval for T would beCurly brackets used two hours. Therefore, the appropriate interval for T is [0, 2 curly brackets].The answer is [0, 2 curly brackets].question: A flight takes 130 minutes to arrive and then 60 minutes to depart. If the flight was 8 kph over sea level at#

 Written as fractions, the expression can be expressed as 1 (0.125 / 60) + (10 / 60) = 1 (5 / 60) + 1(10 / 60).Comparing highest terms we see that 10 is greater than 5 so we subtract 10 from both sides and get 1/5 - 1/10 = oursay 2/5 ≈ 0.3 so the answer is 70 seconds.Let x be the number of bytes downloaded per second. Then 5 + 10*x = 100.From#

 Let x be the number of octets downloaded in the first 60 megabytes.  Then, let W be the number of octets downloaded in the rest of the file.  So, the total number of octets downloaded would be (x + W) = 90.Adding the constants now produces x + W (x + W = 90.) So, there are x octets sent in the first 60 megabytes and x octets sent in the rest of the file.Then x octets will be transferred in 1 second in the first 60 megabytes. And all the remaining octets will be sent in x seconds. So, if the file is 90 megabytes long, then it will take 1 second in the first 60 meg#
