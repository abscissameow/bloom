 Carl takes away 4p + 6g = (4p + 2g) - 2 = 4p + 2g.Then he takes away from the remaining 26 left in the truck. There are now 24p + 26g = ((24p + 0g) + 26g) - 24 = (24p + 9g) - 24 = 3 + 21 = 34.Then the number of green hats remain would be 17G + 1 = 17G + 24 = 68.Then the number of red hard hats would be 17R + 1 + 3 = 17R + 25.The number of red hard hats and green hats that remain in the truck would be 68 - 17G - 16R = 55.The number of pink hats left would be 19P - 4 = 17P - 16R - 4 = 53.Therefore the number of hard hats in the truck would be 68 - 22(17G - 16R - 4) = 66.#

 Operators are in the parentheses.Clearly, (4 * 5) - B - 2 = 2 + 6 - 4 + 6 = 39Therefore the number of hard hats that remain is (2 * 6) - 40 = 72The answer is 72.question: Oke 880, 180 and 240 each ate 10 pepperoni sandwiches.  Oke 450 (keeping his wolf teeth intact), Ava and Duke each ate 17 pepperoni sandwiches.  How many pepperoni sandwiches did Ava and Duke eat?answer:#

 Let C be the number of hard hats that remained in the truck. And let M be the number of yellow-haired people in the truck.Then the total number of hats that the truck had before Carl took off four pink hats and John took off six pink hats is C + M = 44 (possibly 24 and 36).A total of 4 times the number of pink hats gives a number of green hats as 2 times the number of pink hats plus twice the number of yellow hats. So the number of hats that remained in the truck was C + 2 + 2 = 16.The answer is 16.QUESTIONS:Using the provided information, transform the data into a single equation. Which of the following#

 Let x be the total number of hard hats in the truck.then we want to have (x - 4)*(x - 6)/2 = 23.  Then we have 2*23 = 78.Then this simplifies to (x - 4)*(x - 6) = 78 * 0.5 = 40.Therefore, x = 15.Here is an explanation of the first step in the process: Cartesian product is the multiplication of sets. In our case, we have two sets (which are ELPA networks). 1. The first set has the number of pink and green hard hats. The size of this set is 52. 2. The second set has how many times a particular face was removed from the set#

 Let "A" be the number of pink hard hats and "B" be the number of green hard hats. Carl took away 4.Let C be the number of remaining pink hard hats.Then 13 - 4 = 9.John, on the other hand, removed 6.Let D be the number of remaining green hard hats then 7 - 6 = 1.There were 9 pink hard hats left out of a total of 26.So initially there were 25 pink and green hard hats.Therefore at the end there still were 25 pink and 16 green.The solution to the problem is (25 + 16) = 35.The answer is 35.question: At school, Carla has 6 oranges. One orange has 3 tequila#

 There are 62 hard hats in the truck after these replacements.The number of hard hats remaining after Carl removes 4 is 13 + 23 = 34.Therefore the total number of hard hats remains, after John takes away 6, is (13 + 23) + (34 - 6) = 86.The answer is 86.question: In a family, there were 5 men and 4 women. The hardest job, more work, demanded three men and one woman, because two women#

 The pink hats added to the green hats would be 14 so the new total would be 52.Then the number of green items removed and the number of yellow items removed equals pushing the pink hats and green hats jelly jar to the other side in order to get the boxes.For this step, it may be helpful to make a line?to keep everything pointed out so there are marks on paper like this.The general solution is as follows:Let Q be the number of yellow items.Thus 14 = Q.Let R be the number of pink items.Thus, the blue items remain in seven boxes so that R = 7 - Q - R.Subtracting 14 from both sides gives 7 - Q - R = 6.Then#

 Let n be the total of all the hard hats (black, white, or blue).Let's divide n by 2 to get the number of pink and green hard hats.Letpn and pg be the number of pink and green hard hats respectively.  Then n = pn + pg.Since there are 15 blue hard hats and 26 green hard hats, n = (15 + 26)/2 = 48.Letst be the total of all removed hard hats (pink or green).  S = pg + (15 - pg).Silas removed 4 pink hard hats and 6 green hard hats, so S = (4 + 6)/2 = 8.Therefore, pg = 8 and pn = 46.The answer is : 45 (pink) +17 (green) = 79 (total)question: An army of 50 men marched an average of 18.4 meters in 30 seconds on a level, horizontal country road.

 Let X be the number of the remaining hard hats.  Let R be the number of red hard hats.  Let T be the number of orange hard hats.B = T - 2R.Equality (A - p) + b!= b sometimes referred to as Littlewood's Rule is valid if p has distinct values in the subset X and provided that no two values of p are in X is successfully anti-deduced and the rule is true for p6$x.  When this is valid it is possible to derive X=A$$\mathrm mathsf{Reasoning guarantees that }\left( &&中非共和国 Aضحية إنجازية ويقال  اثنتين وانها متكررة على اساس  &40T^A   \\false && 26#

 Let B be the number of pink hard hats that Carl took from the truck.  Then (B + 4) + 23B = 40.Then B = (40 - 4 = 36.Then the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is {236 + 4 = 24.The answer is 24.</s>#

 Let P be the number of pink hard hats and let G be the number of green hard hats.Then, (P + 3) - G = 24.Adding G to both sides produces 43 = P + 3 + G.And since the sum of P and G is 49, we have P - 3 = G - 3 = 7.Using this in the previous equation, it becomes 7 x 46 = 270.Then subtracting 2 to the right side of the equation, it becomes 7 x 46 - 22 = 222.Then let C = 6.  Then, 2 x C = 14.Then subtracting C from both sides of the equation yields 2 x 140 - 222 = 248.The number of hard hats remaining in the truck#

 There were 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats. Reducing the number by twice his takes away 4 pink hard hats to start out with and then taking away the blue hard hats minus twice the number of green hard hats he took away.Thus the expression equals = = = = = = = =2 - 2 - 6 = 7.Now combine the like terms on the left side producing = = = = = = = =7 x =2 x = 4hen, multiply both sides by 6 to produce = = = = = = = =4 x-6 = 13 new numbers, which is the total number of hard hats that appeared at the start of the game.The#

 111 ÷ 76 = 2, so Carol took away 2 pink hats. Let x be the number of green hats that Carol removed. Then, (13/2)*(44/6) = 78 - (4/6)x - 2x = 83 - 4x - 3x = 53. So Carl removed 53 hard hats. The number of hats originally in the truck is 78 + 3 * (7/6) = 222.Let B be the number of pink hats Carl removed. Then 75 - 2B = 91. Let m be the number of pink hats originally in the truck. Then m - 2B = 227. Let N be the number of red hard hats returned by John. Then 77 + N - m = 145. Therefore, the number of hats in the truck after John returned the hats was N + m = 226. The answer is 226.question: Helen put 6 bottles of orange juice and 8 bottles of strawberry juice into 4 identical glasses. She filled#

 Consider these equations of the form x =Ax + B. 21 = 12 x + 4 implies x = 10, and 22 = 15 x + 3 implies x = 18. a)21 = b) 22 =Here Alice removed four pink hard hats. Also, Carl took away four pink hard hats, so there remain 27 hard hats in the growing truck. Since Alice took away 4, the number of hard hats that she gave, B, is 4.Therefore, the number of hats that remained in the truck is B + 27 = 34. The answer is 34.question: 30 people walk at a slow pace. Then Martin walks faster and than they do. How fast did Florence and Olivia walk in total? answer#

 Let R be the number of pink hard hats in the truck.Then R + (2BK) = 29 hard hats.Because CB = 4, CB = B and CN = 6. Then CB = - CN = 6. Therefore, R + 6B = 29.P = CN + 6R, so: P + 6R = CB + 6C makes it 39, so we had 6(D+R) = 39, then 27.As CN = 6 CN = 6 - 6(-3), thus R = 210/4 = 42.The answer is 42.question: Given a graph having 5 vertices and 24 edges in it, construct a graph with 5 + 24 = 27 vertices and the correctly numbered edges.
