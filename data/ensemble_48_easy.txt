 Let x be the number of digits that Sam memorized.The old pi had 6 * (7/10) = 14.5 digits. old = 6 + (7/10) = 4.5 new x = 4.5 + 6 = 7 new.new = 7 old.(the new number)Subbed the old 7 with the new one resolves the problem! Sam's x is equal to the number of digits of Pi, multiplied by 0.24. Removing the old digits leaves 25. The new number is 24. So 24 = 0.24 x 25-2017 = 6x + 25.The answer is 6x + 24. Question 29: Bobby has 86 pins on his toaster. Mitchell and Paul collectively have 4#

 Let x be the number of pi that Sam memorized.Then, let x 1 be the number of pi that Carlos memorized.Then, there are 56x 1 = 31,278,750 pi that Sam remembered.There are 24x 1 = 12,288,000 pi that Carlos remembers.And x 1 - x = 14,176,750.Now there is 31,278,750 - 12,288,000 = 15,472,750 pi that Sam remembered minus what Carlos remembered.There are 18,356,844 pi that Sam remembered minus what Carlos remembers.There have been 29 twelfth harmonics in G major, 15 of which upper-harmonics are also within the first octave. The rest must be in#

 Let S and C be the numbers of digits Sam and Carlos memorized respectively.Basis is the sum of S and C. Let SBI = S + C.Then SBI is the sum of both sides and usual operation will produce 9 * 6 = 54.The answer is 54.question: 4/7 of a lined-up hockey game is a half-off game. If 25 hockey players are lined-up, what is the probability that 3 of them are on their team?answer: Let n#

 Let S be the number of digits Sam memorized.  Let C be the number of digits Carlos memorized.Then there must be an equation complex square root with Vx.Subtracting 84x from both sides of the equation gives 6 + V(182x - 256) = 840C - 120 = 484.24 - 84 = 282.5.Or V= V If Sam has 24 digits, then, by definition, V=1/144 to produce 1962 and therefore mp= 25.The number of the pattern is m=4444+47100+84= 2948200 or 484, so the number of digits of pi that was memorized by Carlos is 484.The answer is 484.question: Ella leaves 500 bananas, 450#

 Let M be the number of digits of pi that Sam memorized. Then He memorized twice as many as Carlos, so M = 2 * 24 = 48.Let C be the number of digits of pi that Carlos memorized. Then 49 - M = 6.So S = 248 - 6 = 244 = M.The answer is 246.question: A tree has 4 leaves, and two sticks; how many sticks were added? answer:5x5x4x4 = 30 The answer is 30#

 Let's line up the two sets of digits vertically.Then the first digit of pi can be placed at the left-most coordinate and only the last digit can be placed at the right-most coordinate as a single number.This can be re-ordered as + + - - - +.So the two sets can be represented as + - +.Now if we want the largest number following the +, we would have to subtract the biggest digit from 8.Hence, we eliminate to get - -.Which would yield the maximum possible number following that + with the two smallest digits, which is 24.We put it at the left-most coordinate.Now we need to make room for the following digit. This time we subtract the two smallest digits from#

 Let N be the number of digits of pi.Then N / 6 = B for B being the total number of digits that Sam and Carlos remembered.Hence Let M be the number of digits memorized by Mina.Then, since 8 > 4 it must be true that M = N = 8 Let S be the number of digits that Sam memorized. Then, since Sam went on a number of days, we can assume that M & N = S * D so S = D * 6 = 30 4.5 = 24 Therefore M = 24.The fact that S = D reflects solid memory when Johnny breaks the vase. question of the week puzzle: The starting balance of a bank was $6,000. The bank took in $2,500#

 Let S be the number of bits Sam memorized. Then
there are 6(S + 1) = 591 bits.Sorting all the bits from the right-hand side to the left produces 610 bits.Let M be the number of bits of digits of pi that were not memorized by either Sam or Carlos. Then we have 610 - S - M = 291 = S + M minus what was not memorized by either player.Now summing the bits that were not memorized by either player produces 293 = S + M.The answer is S = 23 and M = 106.Therefore, the total number of bits that were memorized by both players was 591 = 6 * 24 = 288.Answer: Sam memorized 492 bits, and#

 If there were 6 times as many digits as those digits, then it would be (30) -6 (30) /6 = 7.Mina has 7 times as many digits as the common denominator, which is (30)/6 = 6.So the ratio of numbers is (6/7) = 1.So they both memorize 6 numbers.Generally, it says things in this way. (A Binge by cotaboom)The ratio of numbers is 1.So Sam memorizes 6/9 = 0.66 numbers.So how many did Carlos memorize?He memorized 24/6 = 3.4 numbers.The answer is 3.4.</s>#

 Both Mina and Carlos were memorizing n words.  Let n be the number of digits that they memorized.So, n + 24 = 52 and n + 52 = 74.Then, n = 52 - 24 = 20.Therefore, each one of them memorized 20 digits of pi.The answer is 20.question: The father of James reads the clock daily. The clock says 4:10 this morning. Last night it read 3:00. If the clock does not go backward, how far#

 We wish do the following: Substitute 24 into the equation. Let k be the number of digits Sam learned.So, 6(24 = 6x.Ke from the bigger equation x*6 = 24.Then we convert * into ÷.So, we can use x ÷ 6 = x = 73.Then, divide the bigger equation by the smaller equation and we still have the same  final answer 73.The answer is 73.question: A speed monitor recorded a speed of 140 miles per#

 Let x be the number of digits that Sam remembered.Then there are one more digits that Sam remembered than Carlos so x+1 = x.Thus, 29 = x.The number of digits that Carlos remembered was 59, so there are 9 = x+9 = 24 digits that Sam remembered.The answer is 24.question: A bicycle stores 450 litres of gas. At 6.0 miles per hour it can reach 60.0 miles. How far can it go if it runs 24 laps at twice#

 First, let m be the number of digits that Mina memorized, and let k be the number of digits that Carlos memorized. m was actually 60 rather than 6 so we had (60 - 24 = 36). Let m be 6 and let k be 24. Then we had (6 - 6 = 0).Q then asks for the "residue". In our formula for公事 it says to consider (6-60) as a positive. But this is not what this actually represents. It would have something more to do with a theory in mathematics that is called "Number theory". And we all know that "residue" is the number that comes after the power of (6-60) in math.But what can be gained#

 Let E = 24 and let j be the largest integer less than 6 such that j64 => i = j.Let 100 - j be the smallest number greater than or equal to 6 such that i64 => j = i.Thus, j is the number which exactly divides i.And j is 6.Then the number of digits that Sam memorized would be six times (9 digit number) that number, which is j = 6.Therefore, the number of digits that Carlos memorized is i = 9 * 6 = 54.The answer is 54.question: In the sixth floor, there are 91 floors above the fifth floor. feverish clattering sobtels of a voice scale the five-storey walkway.As he#

 Let M be the number of digits that Mina memorized, and K be the number of digits that Carlos memorized.Mina memorized a total of 24 * K digits.Then: let N be the number of digits that Sam memorized. It had to be 6 * M.Therefore, equation would be 2*N = 24 * K.Express the multiplication as summation, so: 2*N = 24K + 8M.After subtracting 8 multiples of M from 24 * K, N = M + 12.Therefore, the number of digits that Sam memorized was 12.The answer is 12.question: Mike drew a grid drawing on the ground the same way as Chris drew the grid drawing on the roof.
