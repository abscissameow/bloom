 Mr. Sanchez has 60 students in Grade 5.So 60*70/100 = 55 students got a final grade of B, A or B+.The students who got a grade of C, D or D- in the class were X where X is the number of students getting a C, D or D- and 60 - X = B.So Mr. Sanchez had 55 X 40 = 25 students with a final B or A.The students who got a B+ or A- were Y where Y is the number of students with a B+, A-, B, A, B+ or A- and (60 - B) = 55 - B - X.So Mr. Sanchez had 55 - B - X = 25 B + X where X is the number of students with a B, A or B+ or X is the number of students with a C, D or D- and (55 - B) - X = C.Then (25 - B + X#

 He must have at least +10 plus 40 - 6 =18 students that got above B.So the number of students that got a final grade above B would be 20 - 6 = 14 students.The answer is 14.question: Beatles vs Rolling#

 Let X be the number of students that got a B grade and above.Then X*100/75 = 250/60 = 38.5%.Then, 25 - (2 x 38.5% =) 40.0%.40 + 8 = 52.0%.52 / 60 = 0.8.According to me, the answer is 8.question: Bob tried his arm on a wall, and his arm flew through the air. On the other hand, his cousin tried his arm out in#

 Let X mark the variable for the number of students without a B in their grade. Then if X = 40, there are 60 - X students with a B and above.Since only 40% of the students had a final grade with a B and above, X = 40/60 = 0.6.Add the number with a B 0.6 of that x(x + 1).That's (60 - x) + (x + 1).That gives 40 + 1.Since X = 0.6, there are (1 -0.6) students with a B and above, that is 4 students.The answer is 4.question: Kevin found a new MOM AIKAN for Friday night.

 Let E be the 1-inch box with 63 coin that Sanchez found in class.Then 62% of the students had coins of 1 inch in their 1-inch box.comprising the ones grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A-A, B-B, C-C and D-D.Thus, if 142 had coins of 1-inch, 6 realized E in their one inch boxes. That means 62% of E's contents were 1 inch coins, so there are 41 students who got E in their 1-inch box. And 26 students had coins of 2 inches. That means 39% of E's contents were 2 inch coins. Then the numbers were 8% for E with coins of 3 inches.CALCUL#

 Let x be the number receiving a final grade of  B and above.The number of students with a final grade of B is x + 2 * x * (2 - 0.2) = (86 * (2 - 0.2))难度较之前简单，适合初级考生做question: A mom and her daughter planned to go to the mall to see new dresses.Now the per-day rate of interest for the loan is 28%, and the mom pays 20% of her earnings to her daughter every month. So how will their money come to an end, and when?answer:Let the number of days be d. Then the number of days they will have together for the loan will be T = d (1-e) +#

 Let X be the percentage of students who got a final grade of B and above.Then X = 0.4 * (60 - x).Combine the answer to the if statement and let x be equal to number of students he has in Grade 5 so X = 0.4 * 60 + x = 60 - x.Then x0 % = x + x = 0.0 x + 0.4 * x = 43 + 0.4 * x = 42 students obtained a final grade of B#

 Mr. Sanchez found out that 60% out of his 60 students got a final grade above B. This implies that 40 of them got a final grade below B. We can set this as a constraint by multiplying the equation with the opposite number: 60% * (40 - B) = 0Because 60% * 40 = 80 and B = 40, the whole equation goes to 80 = 80.So Mr. Sanchez can have a total of 80 students with a grade below B or 30 students with a grade above B.The answer is 30.question: Johnny started walking at a slower pace, and then with no break in the pace, he walked the distance of 6 laps at the end of the day. How much distance could Johnny have covered without a break in#

 The number of students with a final grade of B and higher is 40/60 * 100 = 70%.Let R be the number of students with a final grade of A  or A  and above.Then (R + B) / 2 = (R - B) / 2.And the left hand term is (20/B) - 1 * 60% = 24 / B - 1 * 60% = 60% / B - 1 * 60% = R / B. Once again, R = 60.Using 60 = B + 8, the last 64% of the students had to have a final grade of B or higher.Therefore, the number of students with a final grade of A higher than B would be.64 * 60 = 54.The number of students with a final grade of A would be 4 * 54 = 216 curious kids.question: In a soccer match between Children's Medical, and Children's  Dental, 2 players in each team orthopedically necessary to be substituted.If a player#

 Mr. Sanchez has 60 students in Grade 5 so the number of his students that scored B and above is 60 * 40% = 24 students.The answer is 24.question: Ellie went to her first movie in a packed theater. She saw two#

 V = (60 + 1-0*0*0 = 40) x 100/2000 = 3 percentage points less than a B.Therefore, the number of B+ students must be 40 - 15 = 25.The answer is 25.question: If Johnny hits a#

 From the original post, we know that 60 students obtained a B. So we know that 40 of them received a final grade of less than B. There's no B and only B, In that case, Mr. Sanchez only has to count students numbers. So we divide 60 by B. Then he can create a counter for each student. Therefore, we want to find the ordinal number of each student.Using the formula for competitive sums, which is Sq=xq = a + xq means sum x to the power q. Now, if we exponentiate by x and multiply by 2, after doing that we'll get adding two sets, becoming Sq = a + 1 where a + 1 = B q q2. Therefore, the M#

 let x stand for the number of students who got a final grade of B & above. Then 40*60 = 24*60 = 1680.Finally, we get x = 1680 - 24 * B = 1934.The answer is 1934.#

 Let x be the number of students who got a final grade of B or above.Then the number of students who got a final grade below B would be x * (1-40%).Also, there were 60 students in his grade.Solving the equation for x gives x=(60*40/(1-40%))4/(1-40%)6=((60*4)5*36/(1-40%))6/(1-40%)6=30Possibly also, (60*4)5*35/(1-40%))6/(1-40%)6=3030 = B+26.

 Hence, 60% of the students who got a final grade of B and above got a final grade of B on only 28.Therefore, the number of students who had a grade of B or above who got a final grade of B or above on at least one of the 14 tests was 28.question: Sean was to drive 160 km in 3 hours 20 minutes. He used a 75 HP car. His speed was 88 km/h.  Mr. Weyland was driving 195 km south of Sean's road in 4 hours 10 minutes, and he used a 80 HP car. Mr Weyland traveled at 61 mph if he drove for 150 miles;  thus he drove at what speed when he exceeded Sean?answer: Let M be Mr Weyland's speed on#

 Let B be a random variable with the value B that represents whether the student in question got a final grade of B or higher. If X is the number of students who have B or above, then we have the expression X = 53 - 8 = 45.Then calculate the expectation of X: E(X) = 50 * 60/ 45 = 64.If we try to find-c, the proportion of students that got a final grade of B or better we have: P(B) = X/c When X=45, we get: P(B) = 64/50 = 1/6. Therefore, the proportion that got B or better was: 1/6 = 13.34%The answer is 13.34%question: 2 packs of gum cost $#
