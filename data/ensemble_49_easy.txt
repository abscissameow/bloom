 Let s be Laurie smuggling off-sales from the store.Let b be the number of shells collected by Alan.And let a be the number of shells collected by Ben.We know that a > s since a is the sum of the three off-sales.
And s is the sum of the on-sale(only one).
Then s + a = s + a + 1 + s + a + 1 + 0 = s + 4 + 3 = s + 6.Premultiplying both sides by 1 - 1/3 = 1 - 1/3(3 + 1 + 1)so, s = 6.Then a = 1 -3 + 1 + 1 = 9; or ally = 90.Then a = b - s = b - 90 = 30.The answer is 30.question: Let n be the number of (n - 1)/2 × 8 meters. If n = 50, then n'is the number of (n – 1) /2 × 7 meters.

 Let A be the number of shells that Alan collected. Then 4A = 2Shells that Ben collected.Then 36 A = 36/(2 A) = Shells that Laurie collected.Then 1/(3 A) = Shells that Alan collected.Alpha = Alcelpha = B and.16Alpha = Alcelpha = C and.82Thus Alan collected 3x12C = 72 shells.The answer is 72.question: There were 15 students in a car. Amy drove through#

 Let C be the number of shells that Laurie collected. Then, outside the choices of B and C, there are 10 choices for A.There are only two ways for A to be equal to the numbers in the parentheses. There are eight ways for A to be at least as big as the first one and two ways for A to be at least as big as the second one.There are only two ways for A to be less than C, and once it is less than C, A cannot be less than the second choice, either.Thus, the expressions become (3:4)(2+3)(3+4) = 9 bytes(2:3)(3+4)(4+5) = 9 bytes(4+5)(4+5)(3+3)#

 Let x be the number of shells that Alan collected. That leaves 56 to collect by the end of the trip. Let y be the number of shells that Ben collected. That leaves an additional 40 shells to collect. Let z be the number of shells that Laurie collected. That leaves 86 shell to collect.Let A be the number of shells that were collected on purpose for a prize. It is given the name dominated above. Then x + z + A = 56. x + y + B = 40. x + 62 = 86. x + (6 + A) = 56. Thus, x = (2y + B) + (A - [(9)]) = (2y + 42) ± (5 - 6#

 The difference is because Alan collected 40 shells, and seared six worth of shells at a time. Laurie collected 6 shells, and took them one at the time.Combining the numbers in the brackets produces ((40 -L) + (6000 - 6000 ))/6000 = 265/3000.Therefore, Alan z collected 266/2400 shells.The answer is 266/2400.question: At a certain time, Michael is speeding down the road at 60 kilometers per hour. Then he slows down#

 The equation converts into 24 + 5 + (6/1) =107.Again the constants cancel one another so we end up with X = 95.What was X originally? X = 94.96 - 96 = (94.96) / 4 = 9.6In those days, one bushel was 25 pounds. We must multiply 97.06/25 = 3.6 by 4 to get 36So the number of shells collected by Laurie was 36.The answer is 36.question: Delta#

 Let A and B be the numbers of shells collected, respectively.Then A + B = 91.A + 36 = B + 36.A + B + 36 = 3.Since A + B = 91, A + B + 36 = 3, so A = 36.Therefore, there were 91 - 36 = 63 shells collected.The answer is 63.question:  Sandra wanted a water pipe for a few years before she bought one. She smoked tobacco for quite a while before she#

 Let x be the number of shells that each student collected.Then Alan collected x * 4 = x * 6 = 180 shells.Let y be the number of shells that Ben collected.Then Ben collected y * 3 = y * 5 = 90 shells.Therefore, the number of shells collected by the three students is x + (y + 3) = 180(90 + 90 +3) = 294 (46*6 * 5)Apart from sharing, they also earn C and K according to their contribution.question: You counted 4+2 you got 7+5.How many you counted without sharing? (to avoid sharing you can also count how many items you got by giving it to another person)answer: Let x be the number of goods that each#

 Let X be the number of shells collected by Alan. Let Y be the number of shells collected by Ben. Then there are 4X Y = 36 shells.Let X be the number of shells collected by Laurie. Then X = 4 (5Y + 3Y - B).Divide both sides by the denominator to get X / 4 = (5Y + 3Y - B) /3. Let 49YY = 36.Subtract 9 from both sides and divide by 3 to get Y / 9 = (5Y + 3Y - B ) / 3. Subtract 5 from both sides to get Y / 5 = (5Y + 3Y - B ) / 2, and add it to both sides to get Y / 5 = (5Y + 3Y - B ) / 2. Subtract 3 from B to get Y / 3 = (5Y + 3Y - B ) / 2. Divide by X to get Y / X = (450 - 155#

 Let P be the number of shells Ben collected. Let Q be the number of shells Laurie collectedThe number of shells collected by Alan can be expressed as P + Q + PQ = P + 3 + PQ +3 = P + 1 + ((2Q) + 3) = P + 3 + (2 × 45) + 3 = 105From the above equations. Therefore, if Alan collected P shells, then PQ should be 45 times as many shells as if Ben collected the same number of shells.Let C be the number of shells collected by Alan. Then 105 - C = 45.From the above equations, we can see that Charlie should have collected 0 = (C + 0) - (45 - C) = (45#

 Let x be the number of shells that Alan collected.Let Y be the number of shells that Ben collected.  Then Y = (x + 1)/3.Then Alan collected x - Y(x - 1)/3 = x*1/2 -> x/4.The part around the 3/4 was excluded because it was a single number.Therefore,  x = 2*3*4*1/2 = 3x.Then, x - 2*3*4/1000 = x/2.So, Ben collected 1/2 x = 0.5x. Therefore, Alan collected x 0.5 = (x-l) 0.5 = 0.5x + 1/2x = 2x.The answer is 2x.question: There were 10 triangles in the top corner and 4 triangles in the#

 Let x be the number of shells collected by Alan. Then x = 4^3 = 96.Also, 82 + 86 = 144.Thus x + 132 = 176.Also, x - 132 = 84.Thus the number of shells collected by Ben is x - 84 = 146. Therefore, Alan collected 176 - 146 92 shells.The answer is 92.question: 15 kids started at different times. Jason's time was 1 minutes less than that of Drake. Rebecca came in peace with Andrew.#

 In total, Alan collected = (4*8) -26 (11/14), where * is multiplication Instead of 11/14, divide 11 by 7.In the parentheses, subtract 4*7 = 28 from 10. Thus his total number of shells was + (28 - 26) = 30.Ben he didn't start his collection until about 3:30, so he collected = (60/(3 Twelve) -26 (6/150))*30, where - is minus 11/14, divided by 3/4. Then subtract all the delta from 10. It is + (10 - 10*111/13) = 30. The total number of shells Alan and Ben collected was 60 - 30 = 30 bags of sand.The answer is 27 bags of sand.#

 We can solve the following: Alan + Ben + Laurie = 50.Thus, we need to find a solution for the equation 25x + 58 = 50.From the equation, we know that x is 4.Then, divide 24 by 50 to find the value of x, which is 4.Next, put x into the next line.Put 26 into the next line.Then, divide 35 by 53 to find 43, then use 43 in the next line.the answer is 42.question:#

 Let c be the number of shells that Alan collected. Then 27 + 4 = 29 - 4 = 7 + 4 = 11.Therefore, c = 11.Adding c to both sides produces 11 + 11 = 22.Using the coral rule on the right side gives 11X = 22.Then distribute it to 4 leaving 9.9X, then divide both sides by 4.X = 0.290916441316.............Times 0.290916441316 by 3 gives X = 0.068420221319......There are still 6.68420221319 shells left to be collected.The answer is 6.68420221319.Our answer is 61.question: How many dips did Stan#
