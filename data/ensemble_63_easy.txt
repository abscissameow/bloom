 a) Let B be the number of situps that Shawna did on Monday. b) Let C be the number of situps that she did on Tuesday. c) Let D be the number of situps that she did on Wednesday. Then 80 - B - C + D = 17The number of situps that Shawna would need to do on Wednesday would be 81 - 17 = 64 situps. The answer is 64.question: Gerry added 103 pennies to his total so#

 We can rewrite the problem with the form: Shawna was only able to do ______ of her goal on ______. Therefore, for her to meet her goal, she had to: _____ of her goal on ____________________. Then she had to do ______ of her goal on ____________________. Therefore, she had to do ______ of her goal on ____________________. Therefore, she had to do ______ of her goal on ____________________. Therefore, she had to do ______ of her goal on ____________________. Now we have 2 expressions that have to#

 Let S be the number of sit-ups that Shawna did on Monday. Then, let W be the number that she did on Tuesday. Also, let X be the number on her objective of 30.S = 12 x 8 = 96W = 19 x 8 = 144X = 30So, on Wednesday, Shawna had to do 389 (96 + 19 + 30) situps.question: A student lost 10 points on her Calculus final and was in the top 90%. She improved her math grade by 4 points and also improved her English grade 2 points.

 Let M be the number of situps done on Wednesday. Then M = 19 + 12 = 31Therefore, M = 6 more than she did on Monday.Thus, her exercise goal was still 30 situps but she had to do 6 more than on Monday to meet her minimum goal.  In total, she had to do M = 31 + 6 = 35 rep.Thus, the equation is 30 x 35/100 = 5 rep.Transfers like recipes can be similar in solving questions like this. Let MSkoolbe the total the number of situps done in the week.Let b = M - Skool.Then b = 10 - 6 = 4.Therefore, b = 4.So, both questions are similar in solving#

 Let x be the number of situps she did on Monday. So x = 12.And let y be the number of situps she can do on Tuesday.Then: y = 12 + 19 = 37.And at least to meet her goal, x + y = 30.Therefore, x + 37 = x + 30.Let 28 be the number of stacked apples, so 27 + 37 = 42 is the number of apples that are stacked at work to go home to Brian. And the number of apples that Brian brought home was 42.The answer is 42.question: Jessica is able to run 45 minutes in 10 minutes' increments, but she isn't sure if she can run the time total. One week she ran from 10 minutes to#

 Let Y = number of situps that she did on Tuesday.Then Y − B = 11.B is the number of situps that she didn't do on Tuesday.Thus, Y −Y + B = 6.Shawna would only keep up with her goal if she was able to do 11 + 6 = 17 situps on Wednesday. Therefore, Tues. − Tues. + B = 11.Tues. − Tues. − 11 − 6 + B = 3.Tues. − 3 + B = 10.The answer is 10.</s>#

 Let M be the number of situps that Shawna did on Monday. Let N be the number of situps that she did on Tuesday. Then, by the principle of total recall, we have: Most of the people who walk 50 feet never turn around.If the person who walks 50 feet turns around after completing 100 feet, does he arrive on site?Answer: (He does)Yes.Reason:If he walks 50 feet without turning, he will arrive at the site his distance is 150#

 Let b represent the number of situps on Wednesday.  Then 12 + 19 - b = 12.Subtracting 12 from both sides produces 19 - 12 = 7.  This is a 7-superset of the set of 12.  Thus 19 is the least count of supersets containing 7.  Therefore, she had 7 of them on Tuesday.Let c be the number she had on Monday.Let d be the number she had on Thursday.According to the 7 seriess, c + d = 8.We have an 8-superset of the set of 7 and according to the seven series, ds = 7.  Therefore d = 7 and so on.The answer is 8.question: Carla made 4 sandwiches. She estimated 1 egg out#

 There were two possible ways that Shawna could have met her minimum goal: she could have done 40 or 39 situps.So, her situps total would be 39 + 2 = 41.On Friday she didn't do 54. So, her total workout would be 41 + 4 = 49.The answer is 49 question :Kathy's test results are as follows for her direct presented English test. 4*16 + 3*21 = 60/my goal is to double this score.

 Let x be the number of situps done on each day.Then they would have have to do 79 x 12 = 752 situps.Let 52 - 8 = 44 be the number of situps on Wednesday.Then the number of situps on Tuesday is 29 x 12 = 552.Then since the goal is 30, the number of situps he needs to do on the following day will not be more than the number he started with after subtracting the number done the previous day, which would be 29.Therefore, the minimum number of situps he must do on Wednesday is 29 + 24 = 55.The answer is 55.Question 8question: Rick and Ted play "rock-paper-scissors" three times. On the#

 Then so it would become 129 + 19 - 12 = 68.Again, distributing 19 to both sides would result in 129 + 68 - 19 = 56.Then subtracting the two before the "=" from each other would produce 70 = (129 - 39) - (68 - 45).Subtracting the same value from both sides would produce 52 = (129 - 39) - (68 - 27).Combining the like terms to the left gives 68 = (129 - 39) - (68 - 31) or 89 = (128 - 39) - (67 + 32).Subtracting the same value from both sides again produces 37.Combining the like terms on the right gives 31.Then, apply the Law of Product of#

 Let b be the number of situps Shawna did on Monday. Then b + 19 = 29. 
So on Monday she did b+23 = 31 situps.Thus, the total number of situps she must do on Tuesday is b+19 + 23 = 38.Therefore, she must do 118 satups on Wednesday.</s>Introduction

 Let y be the number of itups she gets on Wednesday.Then let S be the minimum number that she has to do on Monday.So let S - 12 = 19.Then from Tuesday to Wednesday, she would need to do at least 19 / 2 = 9 situps.Then her total of 18 - 9 = 9 would need to make up for 19.The number of situps that she needs to do on Wednesday would become 19 - 9 = 10.In this case, her work would become 10 * 8 = 80 and not 10 x 9 = 90.Since her goal of 30, Shawna worked at least 30 on the left side to make up for what she didn't do. The number of situps that she did became 90#

 Let S be the number of situps made on Wednesday. Since Shawna only sat up 19 times on Tuesday, S = 19.And on Wednesday she made 40 - S = 20 situps.Now, assume that she sat up 20 times on Thursday. And since she made S (even) times on Tuesday, S (even) - 20 (odd) = 4 (even), and (even) -20 = (even) * (odd) * (odd).We then solve the equation in the form (even) * (odd) = S, which simplifies to (even) - (odd) = S (even) - 4 (even) = S (odd) - 24 (even) = S (even) - 1982 (odd), and so...The answer is S (even) = 1982 (odd).So every morning, Shawna needs to do 1800 - 1982 = 1127 (even) situps to meet her goal.The answer is 1127.#

 Let x be the number of situps she had on Monday.So, there were x on Monday and 49 - x on Tuesday.Then, the number of situps on Wednesday would be 48 - (29 - 12) = x.The equation simplifies to 43 = 24 + 2x.And the value of x should be 49 - 44 - 9 = 22.Therefore, she needed to do 49 - 22 = 47 situps on Wednesday.The answer is 47.question: Debbie bought#
