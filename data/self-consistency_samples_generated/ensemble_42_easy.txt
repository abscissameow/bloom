 6 piles would have 30 bananas each.Combining like numbers into the 12 piles results in 30 * 6 = 180 bananas to be passed among the 12 piles. Let x be the number of bananas or hands.Then the value of x is 54.The expression simplifies to 54 * 12 = 720 bananas.Then let y be the number of bananas / hands.So, there are 7 bananas / hand and the number of hands is 10 aka 10 bananas / hand.The equation simplifies to 720 / (10 / 7) = 12umbers of hands.Therefore, the value of y is 3.Then 68 = (720 / 12) * (10 / 3) = 45 apples.Therefore, the number of apples left will be 45 -#

 Let's come up with a new variable T to be the number of hands with full packs. So we have.Ann has T hands. There are 2 * 13*2 = 165 hands with a hand or two of bananas, then 1 hand so there are 164 + 1 that have anywhere from one to two bananas. There are 162 blocks and 16 that have 3 bananas added to it.And there is a total of 125 blocks and 12 that have 2 bananas added to it.With all these pieces of information, you now have enough information to find that T = 126 due to 1 block with 9 bananas is always linked to 124 blocks with 8 bananas.Then, there are 148 of those blocks, and there are 28 of those block that have a hand#

 Let S be the number of hands of bananas that each monkey gets.Then there would be 53 - 6 = 47 bananas overall so 9 * 14 = 147 bananas = 47 with each monkey getting a hand and the remainder being returned to the collection.Thus, let M be the number of hands from every pile that no monkey just takes the entire hand.Then,  M*9 = 137 so  14 = M with each monkey getting just the hand, the remaining bananas returned to the collection, and no monkeys getting piles that have do not have hands of bananas.Thus, they all get hands of bananas and can divide the bananas evenly amongst themselves.  S = 47 + 137 = 169.In the end each monkey gets 9 * 14 = 147 bananas and#

 Let x be the number of the moonberries.Then, the number of banana chips for monkey x is x ** 14+y ** 9.Now, let y be the number of bananas.Then the sum of the remaining bananas for monkey x is 9 y * (x ** 14 + y ** 9).Trying to distribute y produces y ** 9 = (9 x + 9) ** 9 = 9 x 9 = 9 x x = 9 ** 9 = 1.And that result comes in handy for the last statement, which says that 6 is the number of hands because 6 monkey x also get 9 y which is 9 buttches from the remaining bananas because each of their hands is only 9 bananas.The answer is 6.</s>#

 The required quantity is "&" and the sums to be combined are "**".To obtain the total of the two numbers they are multiplied 12:6 = 6:12 = 1:2.Thanking them as we leave.</s>
Total body irradiation (TBI) is an alternative therapy to conventional fractionated radiotherapy for treatment of certain locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The reduced tumour burden allows several short irradiation courses to be delivered without any constraint of late toxicity, giving the radiotherapy team an opportunity to employ radiation techniques and planning methods not previously used. This treatment planning flexibility also leads to long term follow-up of patients, including clinical and radiographic assessments, which provide an opportunity to plan local control approaches and clinical#

 Let x be the number of bananas each monkey got.Then x = 10/53 = 0.19909 = 19.1 bananas each.Then the family has 19.1 * 12 = 284 bananas.The answer is 284.question: Elvis#

 The bananas can be grouped into 2 piles of 6 fruits and 2 piles of 5 fruits, allowing a total of 4 piles of 12 fruits for the 12 monkeys. Also if the middle valuerive fruit is included, there are 8 piles of 11 fruits.There are 6 monkey pairs. Group 1 will have all the 6 middle monark pairs, so for Medium Group 1 1 * 9 = 9 * 9/56 = 72 = the bananas. The total bananas for the Medium group is the sum of all the middle bananas, so medium total = (9 + 1) * (9 + 1) = 111 - 1 = 110.The groups 26 - 1 = 25, the total number of bananas for the first group Monkeys.Since there is#

 Notice that M(6/9) = 6, M(12/9) = 12, M(9/14) = 1, and M(10/14) = 10.So each monkey will get 1/9 of 49(10/14).8? + 1/9? = 49/9 = 48/9 = 45.Plugging these answers into the original equation produces the following:5*(24/8) + 1/9) = 49/9 = 45.decision: C question titles 1?hand#

 If you can count (a minimum of) ten piles of bananas with hands and bananas, then the answer is 54.Let X be the number of piles with 10 hands and 19 bananas.and "Y" be the number of piles with 12 hands and#

 The number of hands that have nine bananas is actually twice the number of hands that have 14 bananas.Let C be the number of piles of hands that have 9 bananas.The number of hands carrying exactly 14 bananas is 9 * (14 - 1)/(9 + 1) = 83.Let C be the number of hands carrying exactly 9 bananas. Let C2 be the number of hands which have 14 bananas. This is 9 * (9 - 1)/(11 + 1) = 84.Equating these numbers and simplifying produces 33 * (C2 + 1) + 29 * (C3 + 1) = 179.So the total number of bananas would be 9 * (179/3) = 180.The answer is 180.question#

 monkeys are members of a family.We have 12 the number of families.We also have 3 the number of pieces of bananas and 9 the number of hands.The number of families of 3 pieces of bananas each is 2-1-2  And the number of piles with 12 hands each is 5-1-2 = 1.The answer is 5.</s>#

 Let P be the number of piles with hands with 14 bananas, and Q be the number of piles with hands with 9 bananas. We have: P + Q = 12 Since there are P piles with 14 as there are Q piles with 9, we have P : Q = 14 : 9.We define a as the number of piles with 14 bananas, and b as the number of piles with 9 bananas. Then P = 11 and Q = 9, so a : b = 11 : 9 = 1 2.Since there is 1 pile with 2 bananas, P - a is equal to the number of piles with 14 bananas. That is, (11 - 1) = 11 -14 = 9. Similarly, Q - b is equal to the number of piles#

 Each monkey would get 78 inventory returns. This is because each monkey would get a hand of 15 bananas. And each monkey would get 7 returns for each 9 bananas it gets. And it would get 3 returns for each 14 bananas it gets. So it would get 1080 inventory returns. Let x be the number of bananas.So, there are ( 1080x) bananas in total.

 The sum of all the pile sizes is 12.So, the number of bananas in piles with one hand holds 9 bananas.Then, the number of bananas in piles with 2 hands is 2 * 9 = 18.Next, we count the total number of bananas that are in 12 hands.Summing the terms containing the 12 on the right side and those containing the 2 on the left side, we get the following equation:9 + 18 + 9*9 = 162.We split the sum on the left 62 = 9 * 12 = 108.So, 33% of the full supply of bananas belongs to each monkey, or Simb a = 3 108 = 18.The answer is 18.形狀的 duet farber 比較多一些. credit score#
