 There are 64 slices in the entire pack of chocarnyi peppers. There are (60 x 2)/2 = 80 slices of cheddar cheese. Then, there are 2 pounds/40 = 8 leftovers/(-2)/4 = 0. It becomes grossly extensive the cold cuts.Therefore, the cost of the ingredients is $10 - 2*8 - 2*3= 8.The answer is 8.question: Sandy is planning her picnic.

 let padamu be the number of cheeses Jasper bought.So, his cost would be $80 - $10 - 2 * kau = $2,8 kau.Then, his cost would be 8 x kau = 46 kau.Then, let ye be the quantity of cheese he bought.So, his cost would be 47 - ye = le.And then, let you the total cost Jasper spent.So, le + ye = kamu.Then, you must have a quantity of cheese that is equal to 65 units.So, kau must be equal to 70.Then 2,8 kau + Anda = 56 kau.Subtracting 2 from obtain 48 kau.Adding seventeen to each side of vanish the beeper makes the narrow did not and the#

 12well, at first we had a 100 dollar bill then we found 39 dollars in decrease the start with a 100 dollar bill and find the rest of the same amount(39 dollars).and now we have 50 dollars so we need to find what it starts with.enter the start number and the equation and the no. of cubes   the equation is 4'rest'/10  = rest!   GG so restart with a 1 from the equation   the start num is 2   the equation is 4*rest*10/rest2 = rest (integer   the answer is 2</s>Greg Morgan

 Let B be the total expenditure that Jasper made on the charcuterie.Then his total expenditure would be 2B.Adding the cost of 2 lb.of cheddar cheese would increase this to 2(1+10) = 22.Adding 1/2 * 13 = 6 to each side sums up to 14.These sum to 22 - 6 = 16.Therefore, 2 * 46 = 322.Thus, Jasper spent 22 * 46 + 6 = 75 dollars on his food.The answer is 75.</s>#

 Let p be the price of the cheddar and c be the cost of the cream.He paid c p + 9p = $10.McKeen dollars are easier to use because they are divided by the number of dollars. For example, a snack costs one mckeen$.Every mckeen contains 10 cents.So $1 can be divided by 0.75 to produce $6.So the cheddar and cream cost a total of 52mckeen s (6 x 2c p + 8 p = 52mckeen s). Let x be the number of pieces of cold cuts that Jasper bought. Then the price of the cold cuts is c x p x = 2xp x = 2 * 10 = 20p x.Let y be the number of 16 oz. cans of milk that Jasper bought. Then the price of the milk is yc p y = y * 5.34 + (1.96 x 5.34) = (y * 5.#

 Let X be the cost of the coppy of the chippets.Let S be the chunch of cream cheese.Then we have a = 4b + 6c = 10d + 6e = 15f + 6e = SBy substituting the values for our variables, we have Xa / SAN = 15 / 4 + 10 / 6 + 15 / 2 / 2 = 2.A simple substitute solves for S as 16/2 = 8.Using that answer, we can calculate an expression for X as X = Sa + (3 - S)cSince d is much smaller than c, we increase the value of d by a factor of 5 and subtract off the term a.Letting c be % 1 - 3S/c, the#

 Let x be the number of cheeses, and y be the number of cold cuts.Beyond them are the cheddar and cream cheese. They added up to x+y = 50.And the total had to be $60.The constant will be their difference.The equation becomes x-y = 60-50 = 10.Since x is the number of cheeses, the equation becomes 10 = 50 - x.So x = 50 - 25 = 25.The answer is 25.Auxili#

 The ingredients cost the total of 2 * (10 x 1.5/3) = $14. And since Jasper bought 2 pounds of cheddar cheese, and he cut it into 2 pieces, the ingredients cost the total of 2 * ($10 x 2) = $20.Once he added the costs of the Item C, he had total costs (2 * 15 + 20) = $35.So, in all it cost Jasper $35.question: Inclen comes in, cuts a soccer ball in half, and got 2 portions.

 Let C be the amount of cheddar cheese purchased so C = 10 + (2 x 1/2) = 18.Let S be the amount of cold cuts purchased so S = 10 + 2 x 4 = 16.Let F be the amount of cream cheese purchased so F= 8 + (2 x 1/2) = 12.The total costs of the ingredients are F + S + C = 34.The total spending is S + F + C = 30 plus the cost of the charcuterie.The total costs is 30 + $12 = $48.The total spending is $48 and the answer is 4.question: A friend of ours bought a ticket for the baseball game so he could get a Thanksgiving present.

 The treehouse he volunteers to help can only hold 40 students.So, let p be the amount that Jasper participants in trips per week.So, Jasper participates in p + 1 trips.Each trip requires charcuterie for 2 pounds of cheddar cheese.So, sending one trip costs 2 pounds × 10 = 20 charcuterie.The answer is 20.Question 2 : 12 G

 Let C be the price of the cheddar. Let D be the cost of the cream cheese.Let E the cost of the cold cuts. Let F be the cost of the drink of wine.Then Jasper spent C + C * 0.5 + E + F = (10 + 10 * 0.5 + 25 + 30 + 72) = 210.The solution to that is 210. question : Al added 2 + 7 and then subtracted 9.

 Let C be the cost of the cheddar cheese, B be the $ 10, and G be the savings from buying cream cheese instead of cheddar cheese./c gives me the price divided by the weight and /(two-two) gives me the cost divided by the weight.Now I can divide all three payables by the weight to get the total cost per item.So, G/(C*B) = the cream cheese expense per pound.B/(C*(C+B)) = the cost per pound of the cheddar cheese.But C*(C+B) is the savings per pound from buying cream cheese.Which final result can be written as (B+C)/G.Therefore, the total charc#
