 Let E = $1750.and let G = G - E, where G is the amount that Mr. Sam shared between his two sons. Let H be twice as much as G. Therefore, let H = G + H.Then Mr. Sam shared H between his two sons.Therefore, G = 1750/2 = 975.And G / 2 = 775. Therefore, H = 775.The total divided by 2 is 775/2 = 525. And E =  525.Therefore, Mr. Sam shared 525 between his two sons.Let H be twice as much as G = 175000/5 = 3500.And H / 5 = 300.Therefore, G = 300.The difference between the two grand total amounts is E -#

 Each boy received $1750/2 = 750.Thereby, the common worth of the money is (1750 + 750) / 2 = 650.The answer is 650.question: Nina lost 4 apples. Her friend also lost 4 apples.#

 Let S be the money shared by Ken and Tony. Then 5000 - S = 1750 S = 1250 Tony got 1750 - 1250 = 937.The answer is 937.question: Peterson has 5 percent of a gross sale of 1098 units of#

 Let us denote Ken's share as K and Tony's share as T.Then K = (31 + 32 =) 46. On the other hand, T = (31 + 26 =) 76. Therefore T = K = T = 50.The value of K and T are 46 and 76, respectively. Thesame goes for any other two four-digit numbers. With the formula below, you can find the two most-dividual-dichotomic numbers for any two four-digit numbers.textarea.form.ident_3:c14d4120A9ED44393DB736C139B55EFBE primitive.detect_ident_3:onVote:third</div><div class="form-submit"><input type="submit" value="Vote!"></div>hiddenField#

 Let X be the share that Tony got.Let Y be the share that Ken gotSo X + Y = X + (2 * X) = (1750 - 1750/20) + (2/20) = 1020.We can combine the like terms on the left side to get Y = 2250 - 1020 = 1050. Then we solve for X to get X = 1000/2 = 500.Therefore, Tony received 500 and Ken received 1000.The answer is 500.question#

 Consider the cases where Ken got $1750 and Tony got twice as much as that.Without loss of generality we may assume than Ken got $1750.In that case Ken got $3350.So if Tony found we have 15 x 1750/100 = $2750 and 1750 - 25 = $1750, which is a contradiction.Therefore Ken didn't get 1750.With that assumption we have Tony got twice as much as Ken.The answer is twice the amount as Ken got.If Ken got --1750 and got twice as much as Ken then the money would be 5% of the amount which is equal to 30. This is a total sum of $1750 - $1750 = $300 would be of the#

 Let W and K be the numbers of dollars given to each of the two sons. Then $1750 divided by 52 gives K/1.5 = W/2. And 2(K + W) = 1750.They make a combined amount of K + W + total by sharing the money evenly.Then K + W + total = 1750.Combining like terms for K and W yields 945 = K + W.Therefore, the number of dollars given, W, was 945/2 = 385. Then the number of dollars given to each son is K = 385/5 = 65. The answer is 65.question: When Simon bought a movie ticket through the special counter, Ms. March asked him if he needed to pay a $2 discount#

 Let x be the number of dollars that Ken got.And let y be the number of times that Ken got twice as much as Tony.Then 1750 - 2*x = 1650.Add 7 to both sides to get 1975 and distribute as y = 4 x 7/2 = 125.Then we have 1998 - 125 = 7ROLLED - 7 = 2475.This is exactly the amount of money that Mr. Sam gave each of his two sons.The answer is 2475. preguntó ¿Cuál es#

 Let x be the amount of money shared.Then the amount meant for Ken is 1750/2 = $750.L'alchemy is a process practiced by alchemists to transform metals into gold. It can also be used to create certain materials, enchant objects or raise magical abilities. The process involves several steps to transform one metal into another. In the process may also add a "blessing of the alchemist" to the metal to make it more powerful. The exact process is unknown and will vary from process to process. However, most alchemists agree that alchemy can be found in both nature and by individual mastery.

 Let  be the amount of money that Ken got.  Let  be the amount of money that Tony got.We have to find  so that the sum of  and  is $1750.We have  = 750 - (2/3) * $75 = $1100.  Likewise we have  = 550 + 2 * $500 = $1750 The answer is $1750.question: Miles talks about his birthday with his Mom and a few friends.  If the keyword "equal" appeared#

 Let L be the amount given by Sam to Ken. Then 1750 - L = 650.Subtract 650 from 1750 to get 1750 - 650 = 5040.Using the quotient rule, divide 5040 by 2 to get 7504.Then 7504 / 2 = 25.Subtract 25 from 1750 to get 1750 - 25 = 1795.Put 1795 into the original equation to get 7910 = 4750 - 765 / 3 + 675 / 2 - 25.Notice the second "=..." has disappeared. Since the LHS equation has the same coefficient of 675 and the RHS equation has the same difference as the LHS multiplied by 2, the equation simplifies to 4750 = 3 675 + 77 - 25.The solution#
