 Let x be the increase in weight.Then we get 400 -1.5 * 400 = 237.Replace.5 * 400 which is a whole 250 pounds times.5 which generates 50 pounds.We realign the sides of the parentheses, the heat and the weight become x + 50 = x + 2.5 * 1000 = 1000.5 * 1000 = 5000.Subtract.So, x - 500 = x - 2000 = -2.5 * 1000 Those 2,000 equals to 2.5 pounds. Adding the weight and minus the final increase makes it equal to 73.5 pounds.The sensitivity to an increase is not exactly.</s>
Arguably the leading candidate for the ultimate microphysical difference that sets the extent to which twostream RayleighTaylor (RT) instability causes airflow divergence is sublimation. Sublimation grows only as the interface temperatures exceed the grain sublimation#

 He traveled its old path some distance and gained 1.5 miles. Thus, he gained a total distance of 1.5 * 400/300 = 187.5 miles.Therefore, his new value was 1.5 * 1800/1800.So, his new value is 1800.The answer is 1800.</s>#

 Let x be the increase in weight.Then the weight of the cow at the end would be 400 x 1.5 = 450.So the value of the cow is 450 - 3 = 387.Thus, the value of the cow is 1/2 times its starting value or x = 385.The answer is 385.question: Carl sold 10 copies of a book for $6.75. Each copy cost him $2.60. How many copies did he sell?answer: Carl sold 10 x 2.#

 Suppose that the cow weighed 490 pounds, then it gained the weight in 7 days.  Let y = 1.5x.  Then h = 490.  x = 7.  Therefore, the value of x is 7.  Therefore, the value of x is 28.  Since x ≥ 0, then x is an integer.  Therefore, h = 1290 lbs.  x = 28.X = 1290 lbs since it gains a weight in 28 days = 1 1/2 X.  Let h = 1290.  Then, 1.5 times the starting weight = 1.5 x = x.  Therefore, Let y = 1.5 x = 20 lb.The value of the weight is 20 lbs.Thus, the value per pound is 20/3 = 6/g.Let X = x.  Let y = 2 x = 40 lb.  Therefore, John is able to sell the cow for 3 x to 2 x = 3/4 x = $5 per pound (the value he got before gaining the weight#

 Let W and V represent the weight and value of the cow.Then 400 is equal to W/V.And 1.5 times a weight is (1.5) * W.Then our expression is (1.5)*400 = (1.5)*3/10,000 = 3000 or 3,000*100% = 300. (1.5) * (3/1000) = 300.Remember that 300 is the value we are looking for.The answer is 300.question:#

 John is now lifting 400 - 400 / 1.5 = 180 pounds.  Therefore, the weight is now 400 / 1.5 = 200.  Therefore, the weight is now 200.  Since the weight is 200, the value is 200 * $3 = $600.The answer is $600.</s>#

 Clearly, it is worth 1.5 * 400 = 1600.  He can sell it for 3 * 1600 = 6800.There is a swindle.  The buyer is really paying 3 for 1.5 weight of really 400, not 1.5 * 400 = 800.The seller can be potentially charged 800 times about 3 times the $1.5.Run the numbers again and it becomes 1.5 * 400 = 800.The answer is 800.question: Words are the building blocks of#

 let x be the initial price of the cow.  put up a sticker for $3 per pound.  Then the new selling price of the cow would be 400/x.This is then multiplied by 1.5 times 3 in order to come up with the new price.The answer is 450 - 400/1.5 = 46.</s>#

 Since the starting weight is 400 pounds and the weight after gaining the weight is 1.5 times 400, what we are interested is 400 + (1/2*400) = 1600.Question 1: Quarter + half = what? Recipe: 1/4 pound flan ===1 1/2 pound. = 112 1/2 grams. Grist = 110 Mozzarella = 110 grist + 112 1/2 Grind = almost 1 pound yes, but Mumbai cuisine spells it as 1 1/4 pound. Question 2 for all other cuisines (and India too) mozaar is almost 1pound. Question answered at great length on another thread under the last link.

 Let y be the new weight of the cow.  Then y = 1.5 x 400 = 550 pounds.The equation becomes 3y + 4 = 800."What number may be multiplied by 3 and 4 to find the value of a dollar represented by 800?"Is 1 the answer?To see this, we have 3y + 4 = 800 or y = 00:8 or y =....If 5 were instead of 3, the answer would also be 1.To find an answer that is not#

 Let c be the current weight of the cow.  Let x be the current weight after the weight gained.  The value of x is 1.5 x.Therefore 1.5 x = 1.5 x + x = 1.5 x2 = 2.5 x = 2.5 x + x = 3 = 3 x + x = 3 + 2 x = 5 = 5 x + xAnswer: John's cow increases its weight from 400 pounds to 1.5 times its current weight, so#

 The increase (change) in weight is 1.5 times the original weight.  Therefore, the increase is 1/2 times the original weight ( $1.50). But the worth of the cow is $3 per pound, times its original weight, times the change in weight.  Therefore, the worth is $3 ($200 times 1.5 ( $1.50))1.5 times the original weight times the change in weight.There is a quick and easy way to find the worth of the cow.  It's the average of the worth before the increase and after the decrease.  Because of this, it is worth you an amount equal to what it stands fork in its worth before the increase (before the decrease). Therefore, the#

 let w be the weight gain.  Let w = 1.5 x 400 (=3200).  Then w = 1.5 x (400 + 1) = 1600 (3200).Two capacitors of capacities 100 and 200 were charged to same voltage.  The spare chamber was charged with the same voltage.  A resistor of 5 ohms was connected to one of the chambers so that if all chambers মিলিত forces, the resistor would experience a resistance of 1000 ohms. The five capacitors were placed in series so that they all had the same voltage across the resistor.  The voltage on each capacitor was increased by the same constant.  How many volts is overvoltage on the capacitor that had the highest voltage?answer: \$\frac{5\frac{1}{100}}{1}#
