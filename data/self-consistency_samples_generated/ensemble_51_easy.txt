 Let T be the amount of fabric left in square ft. Then 12 T = 8.And 4 T = 2.Therefore, T = 16 - 12 = 4.Let k be the amount of bolt  4 threads per inch.Then 4 T = 2 means 16 k = 4 x 4 threads per inch.So we have 16 x 4 = 64 threads per inch.Then = 16 threads per inch.So we have 16/32 = 0.5104 inches.The answer, therefore, is 0.5104 inches.question: A block is measured in x- Jeans.

 Let S be the number of square feet that the bolt is cut. Let W be the width of the bolt.Let D be the length of the bed. 1840/S+48/(D*W) = W/9.953 because 1886 = W*D/S.(30 - 1928)/9.953 = D/6.4390 question 4:Dree is fixing the solar panel on her school ecomonic.

 Let B be the bolt of fabric. We can express both the rectangle in terms of B, or measure it using B. We have a 4 foot by 6 foot rectangle so B = 4.A 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle So B = 1/2/4 = 1/4, Which works out to 3/4 because an inch is 1/4.By the same mathematics, B = 8 so the length of the bolt in feet is 3 feet.The height, or width, 4 by 1/2 = 2.Let H be the height in feet. The height is 16 feet, so H = 16. Since a square foot measures 12 inches per side, the square feet size is (16 x 3) / 12 = 336 square feet.The answer is 336 square feet#

 Let x be the length of the bolt of fabric cut.Let y be the width of the floor space.Then the bolt's length would be 4 x y.Also, the width of the bolt of fabric would be 2 x (y + 1/4) which would be 4 x (y + 1/8).Weather the bolt would fit in the space,4 x 6 + 2 x 4 to round up would be 6 feet so let x = 6.Therefore, the bolt of fabric would be 4 x 6 = 36 feet.To find the number of squares in the space, multiply 3 by the length to get 9 so the number of squares is 9 x 3 = 27.The answer is 27 square feet.question: Jake eats half of a#

 Let x be the rectangular piece.Then, let the number of linear inches be L.Then lets use 1/4 of the original bolt.So, 8 x 1/4 = 4 feet.Twice P times M gives N.L 4x 4x (m x n) solving, we get x = bout 10.The answer is 10, linear inches.question: Every night Buzz comes back to tell Charlie's birthday.

 Let B be the amount of fabric in square feet.The amount of fabric in square feet is the amount of square, then multiply by the height.Let B be the amount of fabric in square feet.The amount of fabric in squares would be 4 x 4 = 16. The length of the bolt of fabric is, thus, 16 / 4 = 3 feet. Thus, the amount of fabric left is, 2 x 3 = 6 in square feet.The answer is 6.question: Darren#

 Let x = the number of square feet of the fabric and let y = the amount of tissue.Then, Let AC = the area of the top rectangle and AB = the area of the bottom rectangle. Then (4 x 6) (2 x 4) = 96 square feet of fabric.The bolt of fabric left is % AB/ AC = 96/168 = 63.5%.The goal is to know how many square feet of fabric she still has left to cut.Therefore, Left fabric in SQF = % (16 x 12 = 192)/(4 x 6 = 48).The answer is 31.5 square feet.</s>#

 First, we need to know what "left" really means. Let (x) = Leaves of fabric that are consumed from cutting the 6 x 4 = 12 let's.That's x smAnn left 52 new square feet.The answer is 52.question#

 Since the width and height of the bolt of glass are the same, square feet = (length/2)^2 = 4^2 = 8, and a square foot =length x length = 8 x 8 = 64, so we have 64= 4 x 6 = 36.Thus, a square inch contains 96 square feet. Then, the rectangle is cut into 4-inch pieces. So there are 96*4 = 432 in. left in square inches. Then, 128/32 = 4 ~ 2.5 = 3.5 in. per square foot.The answer is 3.5.</s>#

 To make a 2 by 4 rectangle, we need 4*2 = 4 square feet of fabric. And to make a 4 by 6 rectangle, we need 6*4 = 24 square feet of fabric.Adding the two values together gives 72 square feet. The answer is 72.question: Brad and Charlie caught 83 crabs in a trap. On Monday the first day, Brad caught 8 crabs, and Charlie caught another 11. Then on Tuesday, the day after, they caught 25.

 Let S be the bolt of fabric. Then S x(4 + 2) = 64 square feet. Thus, the size of curtains left in square foot is 4 SUMS 4 + 2 = 8sqft.answer: Let S be the square feet of fabric for the curtains.Then S x(6 + 2) = 126 square feet of fabric.Thus, the size of the fabric left in square foot is 6 SUMS 6 + 2 = 12sqft.Answer: The#

 If a square is cut from 4 feet by 6 feet, the cut would be 1/4./4 = 1 inch.Therefore, 1/4 * 16 would be 1 square feet.If another square were cut from 2 feet by 4 feet, that would be 1/2 square./4 = 2 1/2. Therefore 3/4 * 4 would be 2 1/2 square feet.Therefore, there remained 2 1/2 - 1 = 1 1/2 square feet of fabric.So the remaining fabric would be 6 + 1 1/2 = 10 sq ft.The answer is 10 Square Feet.question: Marta has paint for 26 feet to paint the wall of a room.

 1 man x 801/2 minutes = accumulated speed x total lengthOf the sports team x time to race round the track.ARestimate is given for the speed of a sportsman so they race 2 laps.Then:Sp*Total Length = Speed of athlete * Total Distance / Round. Because their race length is twice the distance, the total distance is longer by a factor of 4/2 = 2 dab.Therefore, the average speed is (2 * Sp) / (4 * dab).This is equal to 2 x (1/2) x 174/5.Each run takes less than 0.1681 minutes, so the average speed is equal to (2 * 2) x 0.0081 = 1.5 m/s.The answer is 126#

 Let m be the length of the bolt of fabric.Let m = 16m = 12m = 48m = 48 = 4*8 = 4 feet in inches.So Mariana cut a 4 foot square twice to cut it into a 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle.The bolts are each 48 inches wide.So 4 / 8 = 0.5 the square of the bolt.Just divide between the square root of 4, so 4 / 0.5 = 3.5 inches. Let P = 3.5m = P = 270 square feet of fabric.Thus the bolt was 270 / 16 = 143 square feet.question: Robert bought a truck to load the game bag filled with tennis balls.
