 Say every potatoe is tied to a cucumber, so the number of potatoes = (237 - 60) / Cucumber.Then change the denominator into potatoes.We know that the cucumbers are twice as many as the peppers.So the number of peppers = 92 / Cucumber.Therefore, the number of peppers is (237 - 60) / Cucumber * 2 that is 60 cucumbers.So the number of vegetables is 60 + 9 = 69.The answer is 69.question: 45 cans of soda are going to be given to boys and girls at once. They are grouped together randomly in 6-foot by 6-foot tables.  Max and Chris are in one table. His table includes 11 boys, 8 girls#

 Let T represent the number of peppers, C the number of cucumbers and P the number of potatoes.Then the number of vegetables produced would be T + C + P = 275.Therefore, 2/3 of the vegetables were peppers, 3/8 were cucumbers and 1/4 were potatoes.The answer is 2 / 8 / 1.question: Last week, Alex and Georgey spent [at least $224.45]  Plus each of them paid  For 3 adult beverages,#

 Let y be the number of cucumbers and z be the number of peppers.Then (237 - 60 - y)/z = 345-34.Raise y + z to the power of 2 so it becomes 232/52 = (22*52 + 4*52 + 8*52) * 52To solve for y, we have 232/52 = (22 - 4*52 - 8*52)*52 = 154.Therefore, y = 154 cucumbers.The answer is 154.#

 Let y be the number of cucumbers and z be the number of peppers.Then the number of potatoes would be y + z = 60.Then, the number of vegetables that the garden produced would be 70 - 2 * z = 237.The answer is 237.question: Caileen told Vanessa she had won a race for imaginary money. Caileen and Vanessa ran a race with fuzzy eggs. Ten miles of the race ran through the balcony which was lined with silk#

 Let A, C be the numbers of potatoes and cucumbers and let V be the number of peppers. Cancelling out their respective equation (237-A=C+V,60-C=V,56+V=A) results in A+30 = C+V,60-30+30 = 56+V,2 C^2 = 6 V. The peppers draw back 2 times the cucumbers, therefore the equation can be simplified to 2 V = (12 + 56) - 30 - 60 = (60-30+10) - (46-30). Adding 80 to both sides yields 2 V = 116 - (46 + 80) + (30 + 80) - (60 - 30). Putting hitches and subtracting yields 2 V = 125 - 32 + 28 - 60. The equation simplifies to 2 V = 62 - (32 + 32) - (28 + 32) - (60 - 30) = 29 - (58 - 30) = 29.Therefore 193#

 Let x be the number of potatoes. Then 60 - 3x - 3x = 53 = 23 pots of potatoes.Adding the cucumbers produces 57 = 23 cucumbers + 3x = 53 cucumbers.The number of peppers is 2x = 23 peppers.Therefore, the number of vegetables is 53 + 23 + 23 = 94.The answer is 94.question: The angle from the point A to the point B is 113 degrees. From the point B to the point C, it is#

 Let x be the number of vegetables of each type.Thus, 7 * 15 + 12 * 36 + 6 * 60 = (237 - 6 - 60) * 3 * 3 = 5380.Therefore, the number of vegetables was (237 - 6 - 60) * 3 = 5380 - 8 = 4784.The answer is 4784.question: Elroy had 12 apples for breakfast, 18+ apples for lunch. Then José's brother Levi gave him 9 apples. Elroy alm#

 Let V be the number of cucumbers.Then the number of potatoes would be 240 - V + 60.Similarly, let C be the number of peppers. Then the number of cucumbers would be 239 - V + C.Let P be the number of potatoes.Then the number of potatoes would be P ( 1 + C ).Therefore, P = 240 ( 1 + C ) = 234.The answer is 234.question: If a utility company supports EV charging for home#

 Let Y be the number of vegetables.Then (237 - 60 - x) = (238 - 61 - x) to produce Y.This is because we want to find the number of vegetables that sum to 238.Then let x be the number of cucumbers that is twice as many as the number of peppers so we have (238 - 61)/2 = (237 - 60)/2.Then (238 - 61)/2 - 60 = (237 - 60)/2 - 61/2 = 4 vegetable.Therefore, x = 4.Certainly plant = 4 vegetables.The answer is 4.question: Charlie is fed juice, which has 46 ml of sugar in a 500 ml bottle.

 238 //potatoes // cucumbers// peppers//  Cucumbers // (2*60 + 18)// (2*60 + 6*18) = (2*60 + 6*18) - 238 - 60 = 118 The correct answer is 118.</s>#

 Let v be the number of vegetables that the garden produced.Then the number of potatoes was 237/2 v.Combining like terms gives 57.5 - v = 137.5v/2.Then, adding both sides, we get 1.13(v/2) v = 137.5v/2.Divide both sides by 2 and you have v = (1.1357)v/2^2 - 1 = 65.5v/2 > 0.5.The answer is 65.5 < 237.question: Two identical lobsters drive a car with two thirds of the fuel used by one lobster driving alone.
