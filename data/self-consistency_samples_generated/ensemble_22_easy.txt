 Let w be the number of letters in Bobbie’s last name.Let z be the number of letters in Emma’s last name.Then 57 - w - z = z.Adding w to both sides gives 54 = w + z.Then modify the left side as follows 58 = (w + z) - (w - z).Transfer z to the right side as follows 49 = ((w + z) - (w - z)) - ((w + z) - (w - z)) thus giving us 49 - ((w + z) - (w - z)) = 0.Solve for w and remember that z must be positive. w =(49 - (2 * 7)) / 7 - 1 = 50 - 6 - 6 - 1 = 3.To solve for z, let there are 50 different letters. z=50/3.Thus z=3.The answer is 3.question: In one country, people drive on the left side of the road; people#

 Let x be the number of letters in Jamie’s last name.  Let y be the number of letters in Samantha's last name.Then the difference x - y = 3.As x + y = 5, subtracting x - y from both sides creates 5 * 3 = 15.Then, distribute 15 equally to x and y, so we have x = 3 and y = 5.Then, subtracting x - y from both sides is 3 * 5 = 15.Multiply x by 3 and y by 5 to create 3 * 5 = 15.The figure above completed the center so x = 6 and y = 9.Therefore, Jamie’s last name has 6 letters.Samantha’s last name has 9 letters.The answer is 72#

 Let x be the number of letters in Samantha's last name.And the location of the two letters removed would be the index of the xth letter in Bobbie's original last name.Thus, x + 1 is the index of the xth letter in Bobbie's original last name.  So x + 1 = 7.  Also, 0 = -1.  Thus x = -5.The equation simplifies to -5x + 7x = 31.Then transfer 7 to x to convert the previous equation to 2x-5 = 31.After analyzing the expression for x, we would have x=-6.Then x would be the number of letters in Samantha's last name (whose name would be Samantha - 6 letters).Thus, Samantha's last name would#
