 Let y be the money A earns per day or the money the babysitters earn per day. So in total, they will earn y * 52 = $520 over a year.Let Bob’s hourly wage be H and Sally’s hourly wage be S. Then Sally and Bob earn:S*52*52/8 = 140 hours of work over a year.Thus each one will earn:H*0.75*52*0.75/8 = 25 hours over a year. (About the time it takes them to earn ~$55 per week.) So if Bob has earned 42 hours a week over 52 weeks and Sally has earned 29 hours, then they have earned $751 in a 52 week year. To earn ~$1,010#

 Let S be Sally's earnings in dollars per day and B be Bob's earnings in dollars per day. Thus: S + B = S * 0.5 + O.5B = (20 * 0.5) + O.5 (20 * 0.5) = 27.5.Max the formula of sum of squares, so S = 11 and B = 9.Sum the numbers, S + B = 18 so that the total saved for the trip at the end of the year would be 18.The answer is 18.question: A plastic bag contains 3 tubes of red paint, 7 tubes of green paint, and 9 tubes of blue paint. Which color would the paint out of the bag be if only 2 of the#

 Sally earned $550 and Bob earned $450 from week one to the end of the year. Thus their net earnings are ($530 - $450) = $250. Adding the staycation money to the savings ($250 + $114) equals $306. Subtracting the $2 earned as babysitters gives $290 for trips. Thus, the net money they make for their trip is ($290 - $114) = $176. The answer is $ 176.question#

 Sally and Bob have earned $8 during the 2 weeks that they're babysitting. Silly = $8 / 2 weeks = $6. The answer is $4.question: Angela decided to spend $12 on an apple. She spent other $16 on a#

 Let S be the amount of money that Sally has saved and B be the amount that Bob has saved. Then (2S - B) = (2S + B)/2.Solving gives 2S - (2S - B) = B, or S = B + 1/2. Therefore, the total amount of money that both Sally and Bob's have saved for a year will be S = B + 1/2 = B + 3/4 = B + 3/4 = B + 2/3 = B + 2/3 = B + 1/2.
Examples:1. Write the following expressions in terms of B:(1 - x)(3 - 2x)(3 - x)(x - 1)(x - 1)(x - x +7)(x - +5)(x - +7)(+2 - +8)(x - +9)(x+1 + 3x)(x+1 - 2x)(x+1 - 3x)(x+7 - 3x)(x+9 - 2x)(x +9 - +5)(x +9 - +8 )(+2 +#

 Let X be the amount of money that both Sally and Bob have saved.So, X = 6 + 4 = 10.Now we need to divide X by 12.So X/5 = Sally's per day $5 = 2/3 = 2/3 per day.Therefore, X/12 = Bob's per day $12/2 = 8/4 = $4 per day.Now we can sum Sally's per day $12/2 = $4 plus Bob's per day 8/4 = $4.So the total amount of money they have saved for their trip is X = 10 + 4 = 14.Thus, the total amount of money they will have saved for their trip is (1/2 of the money they have earned on their babysitting) + (2/3 of the money they#

 Sally has worked 8 days, so she earned $8.  However, because she ended her job early, she saved 4 of those 8 times, for $2.So, she has $10 for her own trip. Bob has worked 16 days, so he earned $28.  He also saved $4.  So, he has $32 for his own trip.So, Sally and Bob have $36 for their trip.the answer is 36.question: Colombuses are three circles with three stars on each of their#

 Sally's income will be 6 * 180/192 days = 1.8 dollars per month or 15.4 dollars per quarter. Join the two income values to give 24.8 dollars per year.Bob's income will be 4 * 160/192 days = 12.2 dollars per month or 24.4 dollars per quarter. Join the two income values to give 48.4 dollars per year.The answer is 24.8 + 48.4 = 98.8.questions:  How many#

 Sally now has 3148$. And Bob has 3875$.So they have already saved 960$ accordig to their average salaries.What's the amount?Answer: The amount is 960 / 2 = 450.The solution is 450$.#

 Let C be the amount Sally saved. Let D be the amount Bob saved. Let M be the money they will each have saved after a year. Then C = $6 and D = $4. M = C + D = 10.After a year, Sally's collected $6 + M = $10. Bob's collected $4 + M = $10. Therefore, M = $2 since M is the difference between C and D.The answer is 2.question: Harry read a novel for 4 hours yesterday while#

 Let x be the earnings of Sally and y be the earnings of Bob. The amount of money they will have saved will be (2 * ($x - y)) * 365 /12 = 2760.The year has 12 months so they would have made $315 (2760 x.365 / 12) as interest on that amount.Let 1/4 that amount be in dollar cents for a total of $189.Let the amount of interest be 8% per year.Thus, the amount earned by Sally and Bob would be $412.426 dollars and dollars. Both have made about $643 dollars and cents. The answer is $643.question: Jerry bought one extra book today, costing $10. He then bought three books totaling $50.#

 Let T be the total money that the 2 babysitters have together in savings after a year.So, the total amount of money that each babysitter has saved is 6x members - 4x members = 4 times the sum of $6 for Sally and $4 for Bob.Thus, T = 6x members + 4x members = 36 + 12 = 50.Let S be the sum of the accumulated interest each babysitter has earned on that money.So the answer is 6*S + 4*S = 36 + 12 = 50 x 2 = 100.The answer is 100.question: In a supermarket, there are 9 cheap strawberries and 12 expensive ones on the shelf.

 Sally and Bob have earned 15 * (4 + 6)/2 = $108.50. After a year they will save half of that or 10.8.Thus, they will have 18.08.Now solve for A.The equation simplifies to 18.08 * 1/12 = 3.9 = A.Thus, after a year they will have 230.9.The answer is 230.9.question: If John completed 110 minutes of a walk yesterday and 81 minutes of a#

 Let Q be the amount of money on the ground before they split it.So Q + S + 0 = S + Q.Then Q = 0 - S = -6.Basing fact on the solution above.Now assume that they have saved 6 months worth of money because it would mean what they have at the end will be a quarter over their standard. Hence, the savings will be 6 months *1$ day * 6 months/$quarter/2 = $50.The amount they have is 6 + 50 = 6$.Therefore, subtract the bottom from the top把我们已知的答案,σ角度的斜率 β 為 45 ，.c sed angle的斜率即可动. 用直角三角形的線段，. c on管 déplacements dans \#

 Let A be initial/starting money.Bob makes $6-$4/x1 = $4-x1 = $1 after a year.Suppose that Sally made x1/2 = x1 x 2/3 = x1 x (1 - 2/3) = x1(1 - 1/3)(1 - 1/6) = x1(1 - 1/2) after a year.Therefore, A = x1/2 + x1(1-x1/(1-1-1/6)).We have A = x-+ x1(1-x1/(1-1-1/6)) = (1-x1/(1-1-1/6)) + x = (1/2) + x = x.Thus, B = (1/2) + x = x = B.Therefore, A = 6 + 4x = 10, or x = 4.Thus, after a year they will have $40.The answer is 4.question: At the end of the year, Carl is dealing in 17 stripes.
