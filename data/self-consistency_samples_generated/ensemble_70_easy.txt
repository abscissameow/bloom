 Let x be the number of apples Sarah has. Firstly, let u be the number of apples Tim has less than Martha, u = 30 - 30 = 10.Next, let a be the number of apples that Harry has. Then x - a = 30.Total: u + x = 50.Therefore, Harry has 10 apples less than Martha.The answer is 10.question: Jill does the lunch room duty on Wednesday. If she did it on Monday, then there must be 10 apples#

 Let E be the number of apples that Tim has, M be those that Martha has. Let F be those that Harry has.Then E*-M = HF - MF.Therefore, HF - MF = M + E* - HT.So这就是一个很好的建议。静心地做起来！将公式和术语都熟记于心，然后再来解析对方这道题吧~shak~准备好了吗?来吧!</s>When she gets up,she'll tell me what to do around the house,after I go to work.

 Let x be the number of apples Harry has.Then the number of apples Tim has would be x - 30.And the sum of all the apples would be x + 30 = 60, thus the expression simplifies to (x - 30) + 30 = 60.Idividing both sides by 30 to get 30x gives (x - 30) 3 = 60.Letting x = 3 would get (x - 30) = 60 3x = 350. muddy - 30 x = 100, the answer is 100.question: Knute lost half of his soccer team's goals on a future match, and half of his team now lost two goals on the next match. Knute won 2 goals and lost 1 goal on the prior match#

 Let A be the number of apples that the two friends have.Then 52 - 30 + 26 - 8 = 44.Subtracting 44 from both sides produces 32.Then 32/(52 - 30 + 26 - 8) = 1/4So Harry has 1/10th as many apples as Tim.The answer is 11/10.question: Lance burned (up) 4 sandwiches on one day and sold 4 sandwiches on the next day. Henry ate 2 sandwiches on the third day. What was the total#

 Let H be the number of apples Harry has.  Let M be the number of apples Tim has.  Let T be the number of apples Martha has.  Then 38 M + T + 8 = 68.Distributing 19 to M leads to 38 M = 31. Rubbing the constant T to T + 8 produces 36 + 8 = 50. So Harry has 50.The answer is 50.question: An appleeater gives the egg to Bill, then to Bill's brother, and then to Bill#

 Let T be the number of apples Tim has and let H be the number of apples Harry has.Then 45 + 30 - H = 25.Then 25 / (50 - H) = 80 / (67 - T.Using 10 52 = 5.5. (T + H) percent pans. Let x be the number of apples Tim has.Then let 50 - H = 50 - 50 x = 10 x x So take 10 to the power of x and we get 50 - 50 x = 5000 x.Then 5000 T = T and T x = T. Then 67 T = 67.So let 100 be the amount of percent that Charlie has completed the project.So let 50 2000 100 = A and same ways, A T = A and T x = T. Let 67 T = 67 x and 10 H = 10 x. Then we get 100 H = 10 x and 100 (A + T) = 10 x A x. Then 100 (3 + 5) = 550.#

 Let a be the number of apples that Tim has. McCarthy = a - 29. Then McCarthy = 30 - 9. Then Martha = 32 - 29. Taylor = 2a - 12. Then Harry = 32 - 12 = 35.The alernative way to solve this problem is to subtract 29 from both sides but then to combine like terms.Thus 32 - 29 - 29 = 52 - 29 = -17.Question 21b: When you eliminate your own multiples, you eventually end with a remainder that has a common factor with the sum of your numbers. When you make a mistake, you leave behind a remainder that has a common factor with the sum of your numbers.

 Tim has 30 less ones than Martha.mark washing dishes does not take the same time as counting. That is, the time spent time I mark '5' here is not equal to the time I spent just counting. So each time I mark a '5' I slack in the washing tarea. Then there are more uses time of '5' instead of just counting. So lets introduce our lateness variable:L = the overall amount of "over" we havebetween C and TIt's easy to see that sadly, L cannot be 1 because the total amount of overwe have must be odd: it must be either 1 + n', or 1 + (n+1)'), where n' is the number of C-C examples, as both must#

 There are 75 apples.And unlike Tim, Harry has all 30 apples.So, if Tim had half as many apples as He, then the number of apples that Harry would have is 45 - 30 = 15.The answer is 15.question:#

 Let A be the number of apples that Tim has. Then A - 30 = 68.Adding +30 = A + 30 = 69.Subtracting 68 from both sides produces 62 = A - 68.The value of x in the transformed equation is 70/x = 52.Therefore, the answer is 62.question: George took a drug on Monday, ran 400 meters (444 steps) on Tuesday, and ran 275 steps on Thursday.  How many steps did he run on Friday( Ditto#

 Not all of Martha's apples (31) are less than Tim's (30).So those 2 differences combined should add up to 3.The apples of Martha less than Tim's would be -31 + -30 = 3.March's apples more than Tim's would be 31 + 30.Then they combine to give 52 = -31 + -30 + 31 + 30 = 35. Therefore, Harry would have 52 apples- 35 = 17. The answer is 17.question: Jim's house is only#

 Let C be the number of fewer apples that he has than Martha. Then 45 + C = 68.Thus, there are C apples.From this, let D be the number of apples that is half as much as Tim. So, (68 - 48) + D = 30.Combining constants, D = 24, yielding a total of (61 - 4) + D = 30.The answer is 30.</s>#

 Let a be the number of apples that Harry has. Then 30 - a - a - a = a + a = a.Combining constants produces 30 - (a + a) = a.Dividing by two on both sides produces a = 30 - a.But a = a / 2 = 18.Therefore, the number of apples that Harry has is 30 - 18 = 12.The answer is 12.The next question is supply and demand.Problem: There are 3 apples in#

 Let D be the number of apples Harry has.Then Tim - D = 30.As there are fewer apples played on the stone compared to playing on the sandpaper, the play is 2/3, so the direction is 1 trump.Therefore, the number of south moves is 7/3 so that the score would be D - 7/3 = 38.Then the scenarios for each player would be 7x = 35, 3x + 7 = 22, 7_+ 5 = 22 - 14 = 4.The answer is 4.question: Mark had 40 apples and a ̅̅̅̅ one less than Mike. Molly cut 3 apples from Mark but not from Mike. Billy dropped 12 apples from Mike but not from Mark. What is the#

 Let T be the number of apples that Harry has. Then 78 - 30 - 34 = 34. Also, 68 - (30 + 34) = 17.Subtracting 18 from both sides produces the same equation as the above equation.The answer is 17 The answer is 17.question: Blue gave Jim 10 more coins than Jim gave Blue on Wednesday.
