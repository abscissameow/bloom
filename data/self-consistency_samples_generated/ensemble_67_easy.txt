 Let u be the average increase each day.We want to solve for u.So, we have  -3 = 30x31 - 3x = 390x + 130u.First, we need to solve for x.Letting x = 390, we get 30x - 3x = 390u.Now, let 24, the final day, do daily averaging to get  30 x 3 1+24 - 3 = (21+24) - 3.So, we have 30x -1=3 + 1u.Reading the arithmetic of addition and subtraction terms from left to right, we get the expression to read  3 + 1 u.This can be simplified to 3u.Therefore, the average run time of the two people per day increased by 1 run per day.The average for the first three days is 3 meters per day.The average for the final three days is 3 + 1 meter = 4.The answer is 4.question: Max is running for the state of Illinois#

 Let x be the number of miles they have to run, then the first 3 days each took x/2 = x?5.So there are 5 days left that each will be x/10 = x?2=.then the final 3 days will be x/23 = x?1. Thus, the average will be (3x/2) + (3x/10) + x?1 = 2x + 3 x +x?1.The expected average is 2x + 3x + x?1.The average of averages is (2x + 2x/10 + x?2) + (2x/3 + 3x/10 + 3x) + x?2.Therefore, the average is (2x + 3 x + x?1) /3 + x2/10 + 3x /10 + x?2. The answer is 15/2 + 10/3 + x?1 = 5.

 Let t be the number of miles Jesse ran during the first 3 days.Then, the number of Miles Jesse ran on Day 4 is 10 x (1/3) = 5.Then the difference between his average for the first 3 days and his average for the last 3 days is 5 / 4 = 0.83.So the average of their average is 0.83 * 30 = 21¡miles.The answer is 21 Miles.question: Simon and Martin are two utility students.

 Day 1: 4/5 Then -(4/5)*30 = 3/5*30 = 27/5*30 = 1530/4/5*30 = 1126. The average of their averages over the 3 first days is then 1126/360 = 19.83 miles per hour their final 3 days.Therefore, the average of their averages is 19.83 feet per hour.The answer is 19.³fps.question: With a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, a car#

 So, they must average 3 times over the first three days, so they have to run 30 x (3/2) = 14 miles a day. So, they must run 28 under average and 2 too much over average. That gives them a full day every third day. So, they must run: 28 + 22 + 28 + 22 + 28 = 260.Thus, they must run 29 over average and 3 under average.The answer is 260.question: In an online HARP class,#

 Easy, right. In total, they have to run 54 + 9 + 1 = 65 miles. On the final day, we divide two averages horizontally and vertically: 65/(3 + 4 + 1) = 3. Raising times to the power of 3 is 3 * 3/5 = 9. Raising times to the power of 4 is 4/4 = 1. Thus the average is 3.question: Terry has four friends and lent them money in the following ways:   No. of friendshare lentmoney lentanswer: 1 stake 27.5 $40 2 stake 44.7 $80 3 stake around the topmost 30$245.O’Brien has ten dogs.

 Over the first three days, they walked (2/3 of a mile) - ran (1/2 mile) = 1/2 mile on average.It then took 3 days to complete 10 miles - so they ran about 1/5 of a mile per day.They then ran about (1/5) of a mile each day for the final three days. So, they ran about 0.25 miles each day.So the average would be (1/3) of a mile per day for four days - then about 0.125 miles each day over the final three days.Therefore, the cumulative average would be about 0.25 + O.125 + 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375 miles per day. So they ran 0.375 * 30 =#

 Let T be the total number of days.So, T = 30 days.Also, let E be the total number of miles that Jesse runs.So, E = (2/3)*30 + (1/10)*30 + (1/3)*30 + 0 = 5.5.The expression simplifies to 4.5*30 + 6 = 61.The answer is 60.question: Write a strike, a foul and the season you played on the team you received a free agent contract#

 Let X be the number of miles Jesse runs. On the first 3 days, she ran (1/2) miles. Then on day 4 she ran (3/4) miles. So, she ran 5 miles on the final 3 days.We can go back and get an expression for 5. Then, combining like terms on the left produces 2*X = 5 + 5 + 4.And the left hand expression can be simplified to 4X = 20.Using 20 on the right, 5X = 15.Now we can apply transitivity, so we can transfer 5 to the right side of both equations and simplify to 30X = 60. We have 60/30 = 3.Therefore, the average of Jesse and Mia's running is 3 miles over the#

 Consider the first anonymous daily average. Then the second anonymous daily average is (3/6) of a mile. Then on day 5 averages 3/10 of a mile. Then on day 6 averages 3/15 = 3/9 of a mile.Since the average is 1/3 of a mile on days 3 to 5, we know that the day 6 average must be 9/3 = 2.5 units. Therefore, 10 + 2.5 + 5 = 30Miles answers are 30.question: Three#

 Since on the final three days, Jesse ran (1 + 0.2 + 0.4) / 3 = 21.76 miles each day. And since Mia ran 3 / 4 = 2/3 miles each day, we get the answer as 21.#
