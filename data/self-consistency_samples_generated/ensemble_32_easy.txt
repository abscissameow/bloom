 She traveled 5 + 8 + a little more = 23 (m) after the 1st turn. She only had to travel 1 more = 5 (m) Turn her positive direction = -1 (m)Then it immediately exits the tunnel = 0 (m)Then it travels 3 more (away from the tunnel) = 9 (m) So, a total of 33m traveled around the ring.The answer is 33.question: Levi bought a new basketball湖北省襄樊市襄城区实验小学四年#

 Let r be the distance it traveled after the 1st turn after the car had traveled 23 miles. Then r + 4*5 = 23 + 5*8 = 56.Now r + r = 59 and r = 11 meters.The answer is 11.Very#

 Let A = the number that the car should have traveled before exiting the tunnel. Let a = A after the 1st turn + 5 = 13 meters.Let b = A after the 2nd turn + 8 = 16 meters.Now we know the distance a + b = 23.We solved the problem by showing the following: a + b = 23, a - b = 11, and b - a = 5, which is an expression that represents the first turn. Answer: Let y = a - 5 Then y = 11m.Let x = b - 5 Then x = 16m.Thus x = a - 5 = 23m. The answer is x = 23.question: A pen is marked at 7:00am, otherwise, the marking#

 Let x be the distance traveled from the start. It would be x before the 1st turn. Then 13 x 4 = 48 after the first turn.Then after the second, 2x = 8 so the distance was 48 + 8 = 64.After the 3rd turn, the distance was 2 x 5 + 8 = 22.The answer is 22.question: Let a = 1. Let the distance be x kilometers. How many cycles does the car travel around a ring with diameter 4 kilometers?answer:#

 The car traveled a total of 23 meters around the ring. The first turn traveled 5 meters.The second turn traveled 8 meters. Then the third turn traveled 2 meters and at the end of the last turn the car exited the ring.Therefore the car traveled 28 meters around the ring. The answer is 28.question: A magic shop creates a cabal of four fish to protect the magic shop from any evil, but unfortunately, three of the four fish, Escaflowne, Crescent Moon#

 The location of where the car exits the tunnel is the origin. On the 1st turn, the car goes 5 units forward from the origin thus the new origin is (0, 5). On the 2nd turn, it travels 8 units from (0, 5). After the 3rd turn, at the 4th turn, the car immediately exits the tunnel. If the car is running at 4 units, then it travels x minutes, thus after the 3rd turn it travels 5x - 4 = 3x minutes.The answer is 3x.question: The ice is softened constantly in a big freezer.

 Let N be the number of meters the car had to travel around the ring from the 1st turn to 4th turn. Then the number of meters traveled if the car took 4 total right-hand turns would be (2 * N * r); that is, (2 * 23 * r) = (2 * 5 * r) = (4 * r).Now let r = 5.So it would take = 4.The answer is 3.question: Coach Zossivia is called to coach basketball.#

 Let T = 7.5.Then 22 + 5 + 8 + 5 = 23 and 8 + 5 = 13.Adding both sides to the left side produces 23 - (8 + 5) = 15.Then 8 - 5 = 3 is the answer. The answer is 3.question: Howard, Seth and Walter have lost 260 invites that they have to give away at 58 school events.

 Let x be the amount of distance that the car traveled past the third turn. Then x = 8 + 5 = 13.Again, we use constant distribute to solve the equation.53 - (13 - (5 - 8)) = 5.So the amount that the car traveled past the third turn would be 5.Let x be the amount of distance that it has travelled. Then x = 5 + 23 - (5 - 8) = 54.The answer is 54.question: Sophia ate#

 Let x = 23.Then after the 4th turn x = (23 - (25 - (16 - (6)))) = 7, and after the 3rd turn x = (23 - 7) = 20.After the 2nd turn, there was a little different trail and x = (23 - 20) = 9.Therefore, after the 2nd turn, it traveled 29 meters round the ring.After the 4th turn, it would have traveled to the exit. After the first turn, it would have traveled to the first exit then to the other exit after a turn, and then immediately back to the first exit.The answer is 29.question: Joe bought a flyer at Walmart.

 Let x be the total distance that the car had to travel around the ring after the 1st turn.Then 8 + 6 + 3 = 24.Add all the integers together, which is 49 + 48 + 46 = 119.By definition, d is the difference between adjacent integers where d is the direction that you go. Then d = [1, 2, 3] = [1, 2]/2 = [2], so carry over this to x = [2, 3]/3 = [4]. To answer the last question, count the number of times that you went down the ring from one point to the other. The total distance is 4 x = 4 so you go 3 times around the ring. You traveled 4 *args = 12. Therefore, the speed of the car after#

 Let x be the distance.Then after the 1st turn, it traveled x + 5 = 10 meters.After the 2nd turn, it traveled x + 8 = 12 meters.After the 3 turn, it traveled 24 meters.After the 4th turn, it traveled 5x - 1 = 4 meters, and the turn was located farther than 4m x 0 = 3 meter.Thus the distance traveled was 24 - 4 = 20 meters.The answer is 20.question: Newlands is a business school#

 Let L be the number of meters that the car had travel around the ring.Then, 22 + 5 = L, and 8 + L = 23L.The number of meters that the car had to travel after the 3rd turn is (4 + L) - L = L.The answer is L= 4.question: Jane was to give 279 chocolates to April in two days.
