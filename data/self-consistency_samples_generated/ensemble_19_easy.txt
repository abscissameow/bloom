 Let A be the distance he travels on weekends, and B the distance he travels for work.  Then, the number of miles of riding time is 8A = 200.  And the number of miles traveled during the week is 80 - A = 160.  Then, 2x can be divided by 8 to produce a value of 3.  Therefore, during the workweek, Tim travels 120 miles.  During the weekend, 200 - 120 = 40 miles.  Thus, 90 percent of his riding time was spent traveling for pleasure on the weekends. The answer is 90 percent.  (3.0/5.0 = 90 percent)question: Firstly, Carol spent 2 hours at school and then fibbed that she spent 6 hours at her shop vs the truth that she actually spent#

 Assume that the weekend ride is equally as fast as when he bikes to work.Then every day, Tim spends 25 + 20 = 45 minutes biking to work.Therefore, he spends 1 hour and 45 minutes biking a week.The answer is 1 hour and 45 minutes.question: Because Tim spent 1 hour and 45 minutes riding his bike day in and day out, he got there earlier than the next guy who went on the streetcar.  The streetcar always took 1 hour and#

 Let A be the time he spends bike running on a week.  It is 5 x 5 x 2 = 2 hours.Then on a weekend his rides are 5 x 200 = 1150 miles, 5 x 25 = 125 miles. Multiplying 5 * 125 = 625.Multiplying 625 by A = A x 650 = 6 hours.Hence, if he can cycle 25% faster on a weekend, he would spend A / 650 = 1.25 hours a week.  So the answer is 1.#

 Let time be the time (in days) that he spends biking a week.Let distance 5 times be the 20 miles, Bike speed be 30 miles per hour, Work Effort be 120 minutes per day, then 790 charcoal = 48 hrs.  That is, 790 charcoal / 48 hours = 21 days.We want to know how much time he spends biking a week.So, let Z be biking time.Then, Bike Knockdown = 950 (clock hours) / 71 hours (work days) = 21.Subtract 21 from 950.Then, Bike gain = 950 - 21 = 898.Let Y be work time.  That is, Y= 71 hours (drive hours).Then, Z#

 Let T be the number of work days.  Then T is 5 days.  T times 20 miles = 200 miles.  So the average speed when working is (5 x 20) / T = 125 miles per day.  Also, when going for the weekend ride, Tim is on the bike a day, so his average speed is (5 + 1) x 125 = 175 miles per day.Combining this, we can see that Tim spends (5 x 20) / (5 + 1) = 1 1/2 x 125 + 175 = 225 miles per week on his commute and weekend ride.And the answer is 225.Xl8cis^e lB09l099 1^6^r t^-wjI1 wJ XIX#

 Since he took 20 minutes to ride to his work on his working day, then total time = 15 x 20/60 = 25 minutes Problem= 2500 minutes. Differentiating the given value with respect to weeks yields Since each week can be put into the initial ratio, we can rewrite that formula as       When we add weeks i.e. second week to the initial respect to if the value becomes 0 then it starts becoming 1, which is not what we are looking.Hence we have to shift the origin by subtracting 1 from the total value which reduces the final value from 20010 to 2000. Can you find the answer and spell the equation in full?given value=  given value becomes  derivation of `=  `becomes  y=#

 Traveling meanH_number of workdays ÷  simply fetching his own bike means 20 miles ÷5 = 5 miles/section.And the time to get to and from the bike shop is 5 miles × 1 hour/min. Then the time spent per ride is V_meanH_number of rides / meanH_number of ride-day minutes.So, he spends _5*meanH_number of workdays hours a week biking.It's 8 hours a day if we divide by the 5/11.The total time is 5200 / 1440 minutes a day =....about 6+ hours.The answer is 6.question: When the gourmet chains Rag 'n Bone and Buffalo Wild Wings started, their sales kept overflowing.

 Let X be the number of weeks he has biked.  Then X stars 20/10 = 2 work days.  Let Y be the number of miles he bikes.  Then Y = 100/2 = 50 miles.  Let T be the time he spends biking a week.  Then T = (50/55)x = 1/2x = 0.5 weeks.  So, X = 4 times 0.5 = 1.5 weeks.  Therefore, X = 1.5 calls in a week.  Further, T = (20/50) = 0.8 weeks.Therefore, T = 9.2 of his time a week is spent biking. The answer is 9.2.question: In a cross word puzzle, your name is the 26#

 Let t = 20/200 and y = 250/200.Traditionally, we could solve the equations ty² = 25 and y² = 500 by multiplying them but instead, let us find 5! divided by they cube: 5!/12! = x^2. Then, we can complete the square on x and get x² = 25.To solve the first equation for y, we can again multiply the second equation by the cubes of both sides: t²y = 500. Then, completing the square on y gives y² = 500 and solving for t yields t = 1.5.Finally, we can solve for y. Since y = 25/(1.5), we get y = 1/4 so the answer is 1/4.question: How#

 Let t be the time it took to bike 25 miles.Then, given that he biked at 25 mph, the math would be t divided by 25.And the answer would be 8 hours or 80 minutes of biking a week.Therefore,#

 Let p be the total time that Tim spends biking.  The first day p = 5*25/60 = 1 hour.  On the second day p = 5/2 * 25/60 = 2 hours.  On the third day p = 2*5-2-1 = 6 hours.  The forth day p = 6*3-2 = 4 hours.  The fifth day p = 4 * 5 = 20.  On the weekend, the total p = 200/5 = 40 so the day he takes the 200 mile bike trip it subtracts from p. = 2 * 40/60 = 4 hours.Thus, the total p = 2 * 6 + 4 * 5 = 20 + 8 = 28 hours.And the answer is 28.is there a _____ to give away that sl#

 Let h be the time he spends biking a week.  Then h = (20 + 5) / 5 = 5.5 hours per week.Then, the total time it takes to ride 2 workday legs is (5.5 + 5.5) / 7 = 15.6 hours.Thus, the total time it takes to complete the trip is 2 * 15.6 = 30.2 hours. The answer is 30.2 hours.question: A man with a height#

 Let a, b, t, d, w be the numbers that Celan keeps. Then  a + 20 = t + 200 = w + 25.(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = t + w = c + (e+f) So the answer is c = e + f. Question1 can be solved using the same logic. The answer is c = e + f.question: Jonas is correcting homework for his mother. As a class#

 Let x be the miles that he rode on each workday.So, he rode x = 20 miles each day.And he rode 200 miles on Saturday.Then the total distance that he bike ride would be 20 + 200 = 220 miles.And then he spent 1/3 of the week biking.So x/3 = 145 miles.The answer is 145 miles.</s>#

 According to his Google metric system, Tim rides his bike at 80 miles per hour (a mph).  So, at a mph, he bike for 10 minutes.Then, his bike travel distance is 200/5 = 40 miles. When he goes for a weekend ride, he covers the distance of his workdays in one day.So the total traveling distance that he covered is 40 * 1 = 4O miles.We know that time spent biking per week is 20 minutes/day.So time spent biking a week is (200/50) * 5 days = 5 minutes / dayTherefore, time spent biking a week is 5 * (40/1440) = 2.25 hours per week.The answer is 2.25 hours.question#
