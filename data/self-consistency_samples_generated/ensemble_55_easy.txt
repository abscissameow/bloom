 Let x be the percentage of flowers that are not roses.  The number of roses is 50.  The number of tulips is 40.So, there are 75 flowers.  The divide the number of roses by the number of flowers so you get x = 50 / 75 = 6.85.  The number of tulips is x/2.Therefore, the number of daisies are 35 - (x/2).The answer is 6.85 + (35 - (x/2)) = 9.05#

 Let X be the number of daisies.Then 45 - (25 - X) = 10 so X would be 10.Let Y be the number of tulips.Then 55 - (40 - Y) = 10 so Y would be 10.Let Z be the number of roses.Then 30 - (35 - Z) = 10 so Z would be 10.Therefore the percentage of flowers that are not roses would be (25 + 40 + 35) / (100 - 10 = 90 - 10 = 80) = 90%.The answer is 90%.question: There are 9 good divisions and 33/5=54.therefore there are 90 listings.therefore there are 13 listings.therefore 54 divided by 13 is 11#

 can be solved as ((25 - 40) × 35)/(25 - (25 - 25) + (40 - 35) - 30) = (12 x 99)/(25 - 12 + 65 + 30) = 97/(12 x 33) = 25% Which is a confusing answer because it is the absolute value of the expression, but since it is the reciprocal of the percentage, it can be the percentage of flowers that are not roses. Since we know the total number#

 Let x be the number of flowers.Let y be the number of flowers that don't have petals.Then 2x + 35y = 25.Subtracting 25 from both sides produces 35x - 25y = 30.Comparing like terms gives 13x - 25y = 55 - 25y.This equation simplifies to 7x - 25y = 50 - 25y. So there are 37 flowers that don't have petals.The answer is 37.question: There is a bill that#

 Let t be the percentage of flowers that are not roses.It is 40/5.35 to 65/3 = 0.52.In this setting, the number of flowers not equal to roses is 45 - 25 = 20 flowers.The percentage of flowers not roses is t = 45/20 = 0.2.The percentage of flowers that are roses is t * 100 = 65/(20 + 35) = 85%.question: Karlie has a science notebook.

In what percentage of the information on the power point presentation does Karlie have today?answer: Let K be the#

 Let Q be the number of daisies. Then Q = (40 - 25) / (35 - 25) = ((25 - 1 ) / (25 - 1) + 1) / 2 = 1.1 So, Q = '1' & so off 5, Q = 4.5 + 1.1 = 6.5.Therefore, there are 6.5 flowers that do not belong to the Rose family.The answer is 6.5.question: If we make a rectangle#

 There are 46 flowers in the garden. There are 38 (65\%)daisies. There are 38(11\%)peach tree leaves \(-19\%). There are 13(65\%) of the 46 remaining flowers. \(-45\%\) of the remaining 56 flowers are not \(-894\%)daisies. Hence \(-894\%\) of the flowers are not roses.Be that as it may. \((64\% - 12\%)\% = -896\%\) not roses. The answer is -896\%.question: Wolverine and Batman each share a bruise on the right side of his chest. They both received the bruise while fighting a bat. What is#

 Let x represent the number of roses and y represent the number of flowers.Then x + y = 50.Solving gives 50 = x + y.Subtracting gives 15 = x - y.Thus, you would set x = 25 and y = 40.The percentage of the flowers that are not roses is decrease.</s>Mean Widow: Braime memutuskan untuk merantau ke kota.

 Let w be the percentage of flowers that are daisies. Then 45 % = 1.4. We know that (25 + 20 + 15) % is 0.5. Therefore, there is 1.4 flowers that are not roses.So, 25 * 1.4 = 14 daisies.Step 2 Using the formula, w = 1 – (1 + r) * (1 - (1 - r)) = 0.28655 = 28 %.Therefore, w = 28 % = 20%.The answer is 28 %.question: Noreen has met 5 girls this quarter.

 Let F be the percentage of flowers that are not roses. Then 50 x F = 10.Subtracting 10 from both sides gives 40 - 5 = 35.The percentage of flowers that are iron is F = 35/19 = 18.The percentage of flowers that are not roses is 2 - 18 = 10650 = 35%.question: How many triangles you must cut out from a piece of paper to make a simple pentagon? Answer: Let x be the sum of the number of triangles I cut out. We know that there are 5 x 3 = 15 triangles in a piece of paper.
