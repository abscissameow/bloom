 Let A be the number of months that Jolyn is older than Leon.Then A = 52 - 16 = 30.Combining the terms produces 30x = 60.Now, 24 of the months are younger than 30 and 6 of the months are younger than 24, so 6x = 24.Adding the two sides of the equation produces 6x = 30 - 24 = 6.Therefore, the number of months that Leon is younger than Jolyn is 6.The answer is 6.question:#

 Let J be the block that Leon is in. Then A = J - 1, L = 3, I = 5.All this is in months.LM - +IJ=LM-1J L=LM-1J+1All the letters must add up to 12.Thus, LM-1J + 1-12 - IBM + 9 = LJ + 1针对时间问题，教材给出了典型的例题。例如：A)How long has Duane gone and microphone to play Happy Birthday?B) How long has Sunny gone and microphone to play Happy Birthday?C)How long has Sandy gone and microphone to play Happy Birthday?模块一 测量时间篇。本模块为了让同学们更善于实际应用所学知识及熟知连锁推理规律。剩下的知识面应尽量扩充，掌握常用的测量时间方法，以及有效控制时间的能力。即，给出时间，要求学生测量这些时间；这里给出一个问题，思考这些问题，要学会用相关的测量#

 Since Therese was 5 months older than Aivo, Therese was born when Avo was 1 year old.Then Leon would be 1 year and 1 month older than Aivo because Jolyn was born when Avo was 14 months old.So Jolyn was born when Avo was 12 years old. The answer is 2 years and 1 month.question: Let b be the number of shrimp that Roger ate. Roger ate b shrimp from a 100 shrimp shrimp bag, and#

 Let x be the old age of Jolynn and let y be the old age of Leon then, they are x = 2 + 5 = 7 years older and y = 2 + 4 = 6 years older. Then the sum of their differences is x + y = 9. GST = 2 + 4 = 6 -1 = 5 years. Then one can write the expression as -x + (x - 5) = 9.Since x + y = 0, x - 5 = 9 - 5 = 0 - 5 = 5.Therefore the old age of Leon is 5 years younger than that of Jolynn.The answer is 5 years.question: Georgina had 292 apples. Jerome had 295 apples. Sean had 304 apples, and Carl had 292 apples#

 Suppose Thérèse did b.m. on the 1st of Jan.Then Jolyn would have b.m. on the 28th of Dec.So Leon would be 2 months older than Jolyn if Jolyn were born on the 29th of Dec.Therefore, Jolyn is 1 month older than Leon.The answer is 1 month.Long Division - Lesson 1 Answers Long Division Answers 1. 100/2= 50. 2. 20*6/36 =.25. 3. 18#

 Let x be the number of months Jolyn is older than Leon.Therefore, x − 2 = 6 and x − 5 = 3, which can be solved using the given equation ( figure all the roots you find, and notice that you don't need all the roots to solve for x). This leaves one root, -6/-2 = 2.Note that the sign indicates which side to put it; the negative root indicates that it is to the left, while the positive root indicates that it is to the right.Therefore, Jolyn is 2 months older than Leon.The answer is 8.question: If Aérin's car crashed into another one causing it to be damaged, how badly was Aérin’s car damaged?问题进行求吧,#

 Let both Jolyn and Leon be indexed by a positive integer i. Let li be the number of months Jolyn is older than Leon i years. Let L and L be the number of classes that Jolyn and Leon have together. Therefore, let pi be the number of months Jolyn is younger than Leon i years. Let the difference between pj and pl be the number of months Leon is older than Jolyn i years. Setting pi to be 0, the difference becomes the number of months Jolyn is older than Leon i years.Thus, Let Mj be the number of months that Jolyn is older than Leon i years. Then M = Mj-Li = (1 + Li-L) MJ.The difference between the Celine#

 Since Jolyn was 2 months older than Therese, we have M/2 - N/2 = 2 where M and N are the ages of Therese and the person who was like Jolyn but was 5 months older.Since it was 5 months later, we have M/5 - N 5 = 1.Thus, we have 2 x 5 = 10.Thus, Jolyn is 10 months older than Leon.</s>INTRODUCTION
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) affects mainly elderly individuals, with 2 peak ages of onset being 50 years old and 70 years old. 1 Like leukemia in general, CLL begins in the bone marrow, where the majority of cases originate. Occasionally, CLL cells may also reach the bloodstream, eventually leading to splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. 2 At this stage of leukemogenesis, the diagnosis may already have#

 Let i be the difference in age between Jolyn and Leon. Then i = 7 - 5 = 2.Then i = 7 - 5 = 2.Then i = 7 - 5 = 2.Therefore i = 1.Then Glacier Hills is located in a valley. The western portion of the valley is made up of glaciers, which follow a cliff face sliding down the cliff. What was that valley calculus problem about?answer: The hill slope is 45% higher than the valley floor.Therefore#

 Let x be the number of months Theres is older than Jolyn. Then x+1 = Therese is older than Jolyn.First, subtract 1 from both sides, so the second equation becomes x+1 - x = 2.Then subtract one from both sides so the first equation becomes x + 1 -x - 1 = 0.Therefore, x = 1.And the answer is 1.question: a book has 81 black covers and there are 44 red covers. How many covers are there?#

 Let X be the number of months Leon is older than Jolyn.Then X is 2 + 5 = 7.The difference between Jolyn and Leon is 7 - 2 = 5 months.The answer is 5.question: A ten year old boy#

 According to the expression V(M, B) = M - (B + B + B + M + M + M + M)the value of M would be 4.Therefore, the lower bound of B should be 4/5 = 1/2.Therefore, B = 1/2That is, Jolyn is 1 month younger than Leon.The answer is 1 month.question: Natalie invited a team of friends to hang out for an afternoon only followed by dinner.

 Let a be the number of years between Jolyn and Leon. Let b be the number of months between Therese and Jolyn. Let c be the number of months between Therese and Leon. Then, in ages a * 12 + b * 6 + c * 3 produces 90.And in months, a + b + c = 4.So a = 5, b = −9, and c = 3.Where a, b and c are integers between −9 and  6. Therefore, aged in months is a + b + c = 4.Minus 9 years, 5 months and 3 days.Therefore, the age of Jolyn in years is now given by (5 * 12 + 6 * 9 + 3 * 4) = 252.And 6 years in months is now expressed as (180 - 6)=6 months.Therefore, the age of Jolyn in months is 82.
