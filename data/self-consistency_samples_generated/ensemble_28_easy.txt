 Let K be the number of gnomes on the street.Then 4 + K = 20.Therefore, the number of gnomes in the garden of the fifth house is 4 + 3 = 7.Then the total number of gnomes on the street is 20 + 7 = 23.The final answer is 23.question: 9 midgets, 6 goats and 6 donkeys walk a mile in 6 minutes. How many goats and midgets walked the next mile?answer: Let#

 Let A be the number of gnomes on the street.Again, the total is 20 * (A + 4) + 4 * A, therefore A = 20 and 4A = 8.The number of gnomes on the fifth house is 8 * 5 = 40.The answer is 40.question: Which expression has the larger difference between its left and right sides?answer: abcd - 3af2 + 6 = 6ahd - 9c + 5 = 3.The answer is#

 Let B be the total number of gnomes on the street.Let M be the number of gnomes contained in the first four houses.Then B = (M + 1) * 4.Now, let M be the number of gnomes contained in the fifth house.Then B = 254.Let the total street gnomes be N = B + M + VariablePolesighted so the equation becomes N = B+(M +1)*(4). Distributing the correct terms on the left side gives (10 + 1)*(4) = 204.Combine the like terms on the left and simplify to 50*(4) = 200-150 = 50.Then, distribute all of the "00" terms to variablePoles#

 Let A represent all gnomes on the street.Since A - B = C - D = E - F = 1In this instance -A = B - C = D - E = 1.Therefore, subtracting 1 will produce 2 -B = C, -B = 3. But since A - 3 = 2, it means 1 - 1 = 0.Thus the number of gnomes on the fifth house is 0.The answer is  0.question: Once there were four Braille#

 Let x be the number of gnomes in the street. Then x+1 = 4.Adding the first and third house together produces x + 1 = 5.In the fifth house, each has a gnome so x + 1 = 5. That is, there are 5 gnomes on the street and the answer is 5.description: This section of questions contains a number of applications of mathematical concepts and groups of skills that are explored as a whole. Answers are provided as details for each question#

 Let x be the number of gnomes in the first four houses.Then the number of gnomes in the fifth house is (5 x 3 = 15).Well, how many gnomes did the first four houses have?  7 * 3 = 21 total.Then there are 20 (x + 15) = 65 gnomes.The answer is 65.</s>#

 For example, let a(vo) = 1 if house a has a gnome and 0 otherwise; let b(vo) = 1 if house b has a gnome and 0 otherwise.Then there would be 55 = (5)(2a(vo) + 1)(2b(vo) + 1)(2c(vo) + 1) + 1.Because there are a total of 20 gnomes across all five houses, the equation becomes 55 = 20 * (5) algebraic expression.Then multiply both sides by five so every house has a gnome. The equation becomes 55 = 20 * (2^5) = 4,000.Therefore there is a gnome in the garden of each of the first four houses. The fifth house's#

 Let n be the number of gnome on the fifth house.There are n + 1 house on the street so n + 1*3 = 6.There are 5 + 3 = 8 gnomes on the street, which is B. There are 180 gnomes in the street, which is Alo.Therefore, the number of gnomes on house 5 is (180 - B)/ Alo.Let B = 18.Because Alo = 31 = (180 - 18)/ (181 headquarter) therefore the number of gnomes on house 5 is 5/18 * 181.The answer is 25.question: In a fleet of 20 cars, the average speed of the first 10 cars is 100 kilometers per hour. The average speed of the last 10#

 Let v be the number of gnomes on the street.Then v - (0 + 3 + 3 + 3) = 3.Multiplying v by 4 yields 20.The equation works out to 20x = 40 which is possible, as x may be an integer. Therefore, the fifth house has 3 gnomes on it. - আবিষ্কর্তা: লরা ফলার 485৯ বাংলা બીજ, ৯ম বর্ষ, দ্বাদশ সংখ্যা - 100c: Mrs. Poughlin Plane tickets cost $75 to $90.

 The first house on the street would have 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 gnomes in the garden. Then the second house on the street would have 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 gnomes in the garden.The third house on the street would have 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 gnomes in the gardenFinally, the 4th house on the street and the fifth house on the street would both have 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 gnomes in the garden which means that 20 = 5 + 5 = 10 therefore, the 5th house on the street has three gnomes in the garden.The answer is 3.Question :ognose have an area A=22m2. 180kg of coal are placed in and on that area.

 Let B be the total of gnomes on the street. Then 20 * B = 600.Let the number of gnomes on the fifth house be C.Then 20 - C = 480.Let A be the number of gnomes from house 1. Then 3 * (20 - C - A) = 420.Let the number of gnomes from house 2 be D. Then A + D = 39.Let the number of gnomes from house 3 be E. Then A + E = 23.Let the number of gnomes from house 4 be F. Then 30 - F = 540.Let the number of gnomes from the fifth house be G. Then 240 - G = 200.Then 15 = F - G. That is, the number of gnomes from the fifth house borrowing from the other four houses is 15 = 512.The number of gnomes who go on a hike equals the number returned.Add three gnomes moving to the fifth house to the total on#

 Let T be the number of gnomes on the street. Let Gx be the number of gnomes that the x-th house has.  From the sticks and equipment in the store, we know that there are 30 gnomes in the store.  Thus, T = 30 Gx.Also, the first four houses have 3 gnomes.  So 29 Gx = 45.And the fifth house has 20 - (29 Gx) = 10 gnomes.Therefore, the number of gnomes on the street is 20 (30 Gx) - 29 Gx = 45 - 45 = 10.The answer is 10.question: Bobby's team plays an alternately BALL and SQUARE ball.

 Let n be the number of gnomes in the first four houses.So, the first four houses have 1 x 3 = 3 gnomes.Then, let m be the number of gnomes in the fifth house.Then we have 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 10 gnomes.Therefore, there are 10 gnomes on the street.The answer is 10.question: 30 percent of the trees were sprinkled with body spray on Monday, and 25 percent were sprink#

 Let x be the number of gnomes that each of the first four houses has.Then the gnomes on the fifth house would be x + 3 = 7.And the total number of gnomes would be 20 + 7 = 29.Thus, the expression would simplify to 26 - x = 15.And the number of gnomes on the fifth house would be x = 7.But x is not an answer so the answer is 15.question: The average household produces 6400 toker eggs#

 Let M be the total number of gnomes on the street.If every house had 3 gnomes then M = 4 * 3 = 12.The 5th house is called the middle house, and it had M - B cars - GN. Therefore, M = 12 - 9 = 3.Thus, the number of gnomes on the street is 3.The answer is 3.question: This room is twice larger than that room over the hallway in the engineering room.
