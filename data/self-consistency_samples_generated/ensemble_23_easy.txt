 The price of a pair of shorts would be $17 and they are all used, so B = 4.The price of a pair of shoes is $22, so 8 is also used, so A = 8.The total cost is $17 + 22 = 41.Therefore, the price of a single top is $41 / 2 = 21.The answers are 4 -21 = 19 and 20.The answers are 4 -19 = 21 and 20.The answers are 4 – 21 = 19#

 Let A be the value that Ann was able to buy by buying 5 shorts for $7 and picking up 2 tops for $10.Then A = 5x + 2x = 30.Let B be the value of each of the 4 tops that she bought. Then 4x = 24.Subtract 30 from B (or A). Then B = 24 - 30 = 10.The top at the price of $10 has a value of 10.Therefore, each top has a value of 10.The solution is 10.question: 8 different companies sell two box lunches at three different prices.  One box lunch costs $1 each, another is $2 each, and the third costs $3.  If each customer buys two box lunches, how much money will each company#

 The cost of each pair of shoes should add to the cost of each pair of shorts to produce the total cost of the items bought by Ann.Simplifying produces By definition, $4 + 7 + $10 + 5 = $75So each pair of shoes costs $17.5. Question is what is the total cost, including the proofread?the answer $22.5</s>#

 She bought 5 x $7 each = $ 35, and 2 X $10 = $20, thus her total cost is $35 + $20 = 55.So her total cost is 7 dollars.The answer is 7.question: Ruth runner for an American bone#

 Let x 1 be the number of tops that were $2; let x 2 be the number that were $5; and let x 3 be the number that were $10. Then 104 = 5 * 2 + 10 * 5 + 40 * 10.Hence 114 = 5 * 2 + 10 * 5 + 2 * 4.(5 * 2 + 2 * 4) * 4 = 140 subtracting the constant 5 gives 116 or (5 * 2 + 2 * 4) * 3 + 8. Make the equation in the format 55 * x 3 - 4 = 23 which can be simplified to 55 = (5 * 2 + 2 * 4) / 3.Solve the equation to get x 3 = 52. Then solve the equation to get x 1 = 5. Then x 2 = 4.The answer is 14.question: Mary ran 10 times as fast as Ann on one day and she ran 18 times as fast as Boy on the next day. So how fast did Mary run in comparison to Boy#

 Let A be the number of pairs of shoes purchased.Then the total cost of that was 45 dollars and each top cost $7.Thus the cost of each pair of shoes was 10 (= 0.1).So the total cost of the clothes purchased was 75 - 10 = 65 (= 0.65).Investing $65 and taking 4 returns of 10 percent (= 0.4) would produce a total return of 109 (= 0.105).The answer is 109.question: Cl#

 Ann bought each of the 4 tops for 50 cents.And she bought each of the 5 shorts for $7 and each of the 2 shoes for $9.Thus, each of the four tops and the four shorts had a cost of $20 which equals: 4 * 50 - 4 + 4 + 4. On the other hand, the 4 shoes have a total cost of $80 is 4 * 80 - 4 + 4. Therefore each shirt cost $30.The answer is $30.question: Le#

 Let Z be the number of tops and Let x be the number of cheaper shorts.Let y be the cost of an item.Then, she would have bought (x - y) pairs of shorts and (x - y - 2) pairs of shoes.So the total price paid was (x - y - 2) times the cost of a shirt.And thus, the complete cost was x times 17 (the cost of each shirt) plus 57.That turned out to be $30 total.Then $17 divided by the number of tops, which is 5, produced x = 17/5, meaning she would have had 5 pairs of tops at the same price as the shorts.The answer is 17/5.﻿</s>#

 25x + 27*10 / 2 = 27.Then the total cost of Ann's store sold on clearance is (12 + 25) * 17 = 840.Since she bought 4 of each item, the total cost was (12+25*4)*17 = 4092.The answer is $840 = 4092 / 5 = $870.question: John's grandfather was a collector of 20th century heirlooms. He had hundreds of Nikon cameras, Leica cameras, Sony cameras#

 Let Y be the number of tops. Then Y/5 = 4.Adding 2 to each side produces 8 + 2 = 10.Then let X be 4 + 10 = 6.With this variable X we can express the value of Y as Y = X/6. Therefore, the number of tops is 6.The answer is 6.question: The sixpence in a dollar has been missing for a while. The store was only going to discount a dollar if the sixpence came back.#

 Let x be the number of shoes.So, there are 5 + 4 = 9 pairs of shoes.Let y be the number of women.Then the number of women with shoes would be 5 + 4 = 9 x 2 women.Let z be the number of men.Then the number of men with shoes would be 2 + 6 = 8 x 2 men.Apply constant multiples on m2 = 5 which becomes m2 x 2 x 2 x2 = 60Leave the constant unmodified, so m = n.Then there are 2 x 2 x 2 x2 = 60 male/female pairs with shorts and 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 144 pairs who did not have shorts.Taking off the constant, we get (5x2)#

 Let x = the number of shorts and y = the number of shoes.Then, X = 5x + 2y = 25 + 12 = 37.Therefore, the number of shoes is y = (37 - 5) /5 = 6.Similarly, the number of shorts is x = (37 - 2) / 5 = 3.And then, 4y = 36 = 6x, so the cost of the shorts is y = 36 - 6 = 24. Similarly, the cost of the shoes is equal to 4 x = 24.The answer is 24.question: Rajesh bought 2 cars and 2 kayaks at the same price.

 Let x be the price of each of the 4 tops.  Then x = $50.  Then the total cost of the 4 tops would be 50 * 4 = 200.From the store, she pretended that 50/4 = 1 top and paid 1 for that in order to get the other ones. Therefore, the total cost would be 200 * 1/2 = 50.Thus, the price of each of the 4 tops would be $25. The answer is 25.question: ValumSeparatorvalum is#

 Will let x be the number of top and y be the number of shorts. Then it becomes x = 5 and y = 2.Then the number of tops she bought is 2x + 2y = 12.Then the sale price is 17/50 =.40.So the sale price of:solid top = top +.40 x solid “x”topChoose x from 3, 4, and 5. We have the following cases (order does not matter): Highest value: 17 x 43/500 = 17 which is the costs of the 2 shoes and 9 shorts.Lowest value: 17 x 3/500 = 17 - 9 = 10 which is the cost of 1 of the top.Which option is closest to the truth?as a#

 Let x be the number of tops. Then 3x + 2 * 5 = 8.Divide the left and right sides to get: (3x+3*5)/40 = 14Denote the multiplier by k. (72/40)/3 = 14/4 = 3 indicating the price of a fourth was 3 times the price of the first and so forth. Then x = 3 x 15/4 = 8.The answer is 8.question: Duke and Danilo are racing with bikes.
