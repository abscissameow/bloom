 Let x = (number of tennis balls Ralph hit out of 175)/(total number of balls Ralph hit out of 175). Then x = 2/25 = 0.8Answer:  Ralph did not hit 8 tennis balls.Hence, the answer#

 Let x be the number of tennis balls that Ralph managed to hit.Then 100 - x - 2/5 - 1/3 = 75.Adding x to both sides produces 75 + 2/5 + 1/3 = 97.Subtracting 100 from both sides produces 97 - 100 = 17.Combining terms 6.x + 17 = 9x -17 = 15.x = 15/25.The answer is 5.</s>#

 First, notice that the repeats of 1/2 and 1/3 amount to 3/3 and 2/3.Because of its magnitude, the 3/4 makes the most difference to the answer.Also, notice that the repetitions of 4/6/3/4 are 10.Notice the number#

 let p be the fraction of the 100 balls that Ralph hit.Then if the fraction of the next 75 balls that he hit was q, the fraction of balls that he did not hit was (1 - p) - (1 - q) = 1 - 1 - p - q = - (1 - p) + p - p = - 1 + p.Therefore, the fraction of Gallo did not hit would be 1 - 1 - p - (p / 3).So q = 0.36. Thus run 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Then run p - 0.64 = 1.36. Thus Ralph hit 95.36 % of the tennis balls. The answer is 95.36.question: Eric and#

 Let x be the number of balls that Ralph hit.Then he can write this as 2x = ( x + 2 ) * ( x + 1) = x * ( x + 1 ) x.Then distribute the terms on the left side so x = 1 + ( x + 1) * ( x + 2)/2 Then the value of x would be ( 1 + 2x + 1)/3.To solve for x, we have ( 1 + 2x + 1)/3 = 2/3.Therefore, the number of balls that Ralph hit would be 2/3 x = 178 ballz.Explanation: When First you add the constants x = 1 + ( x + 1)*( x + 2)/2 it becomes 1 + x*(x+1)/2 = 1/2 x.Then you distribute ( 1 +x + 1)/2 over the difference between x and 1. So it becomes x/(1/2 + x) = 1/2 (x2-1) + x^2/2 + x[1], where x#

 Let x be the number of tennis balls that Ralph hit. Then, let y be the number of tennis balls that did not hit, For example, when Ralph shoots out the first 100 tennis balls, out of the first 25, he rages 2 percent of the new tennis balls.From the 100 that he shot to the beginning, he certainly rages 25 percent of the current tennis balls.So the equation should become x - (2 x 25 = 175.Then use them like this. x - (2 x 25)/profit of 75 / 55 = 2 x 25 x 75 = 514/105 = 1.8 has 1 left.These are correct answers.Please find the other answers here.check your answers before submitting. Question:#

 Let a be the number of tennis balls Ralph hit.Let b be the number of tennis balls Ralph did not hit.Let c be the number of balls that Ralph hit that Bowser hit.Then, a + b + c = 175.Transfering the constant 175 to both sides and distributing the 3 integers on the left gives 170 + 98 = 98 + a.Similar steps made for c give a - 52 = 170.The result is a = (97 - 52) = 17.The answer is 17.question: Frank used 3 different types of pencils to complete a drawing.

 Let Y be the number of tennis balls that Ralph fired. Then 175 - Y - 2Y - 4/5y - 1/3 = 55 + 27 + 46 + 13 = 176.Redistributing and separating constant produces 169 - 2Y - 27 + 2Y = 55.So Y = 16.Then, the total of the tennis balls spun off is B = 176 - 16 = 140.Therefore, Ralph accidentally let go of 28 balls.The number of balls he hit is 8.The number of balls he missed is 12.We can remove 2780 = 28 - 8 = 44.So Ralph finished game #2 with 44 tennis balls left.question: A microwave oven takes 1 hour to heat a dish.

 let Abe be the number of tennis balls that Ralph managed to hit.Let NBe the number of tennis balls left for him to hit.Then there are (175 - AB)/(100 - AB) = 2/25 = 6/8 of all the balls that can be hit.There are (125 - AB)/(75 - AB) = 1/3 of balls that can be hit.Therefore, A/(35 - AB) = 6/8.Therefore 55 is the number of balls left for him to hit.The answer is 5.question: Don has 100 books -- 90 he bought himself, and 10 borrowed from someone else.

 The total number of balls from the first 45 hits plus the next 45 minus the first 50 balls equals 175.All the new balls had to be hit in order to beat out the first 50 balls. So it should be 35 to hit the last 45 balls. = 35 = 35.(7100 is the total tare number of balls for the first set. So 37x will give the total hits of the first set and x stands for percent)Therefore,X = 7100 / 175 = 35.The total number of balls knocked out from the machine is 25.The answer is 25.Explanation:Rule 2:=3=5 pursuit for 35 is X=12Notes:Any pursuit for 50 and achieved $200 is marked "hit".Any pursuit for#

 Since he managed to hit 2/5 of 100 balls = 25 balls, then 50 - 25 = 25 balls were not hit. Then 100 - 25 - 2 = 75 balls were hit.So, the tennis balls complement to a set of four balls were hit at 1/4.The expression simplifies to 250 / 25 = 4.This is how many tennis balls he didn't hit.The answer is 4.The Horse Drawn Carriages of Europe are as famous for their historic beauty as they are for their#

 Ralph loaded a machine with 200 tennis balls and loaded it with 100 balls before he tried to play with it.  There are (200 - 100 ) - (100 - (2/5 * 100))) = 125 tennis balls that did not hit anything else.  The answer is 125.question: Bear bought a dozen $20 cards. He put them in a bag that cost him $20 (though he gave no change). He spent the rest of his money buying a square box on the side for old cards that cost#

 Let M be the number of balls that Ralph hit. Then 2 * M + 15 = M And M = 2 * 1/3 + 75 / 2 * 1/3 so M = 250 / 2 * 1/3.Multiplying both sides by 1/3 gives 80 * 2/3 = 125 Since the machine must have 175 balls in total, 75 * 2/3 = 125. Thus 250 / 2 * 1/3 = 125 / 2 * 2/3 = 25.That answers the question.The question is 25.question: Michael searches his entire house#

 high ball will be the number of tennis balls that Ralph hits. Let x be the number of the balls that Ralph loaded on the machine.Then the high ball will be 2 * x.The next 75 x = 150 tennis balls.The low ball will be the (x - 150) balls.The high balls will hit an additional 2 x³/2 balls. Then the low balls will hit 2 x ( x - 50x ) = 180 + 280 = 480 balls.Then the number of the low balls that Ralph hit will be 480 * 1/3 = 220.To total number of balls that Ralph didn't hit, we first have 550 + 220 = 730 and then adjust the 220 for the fact that there are 75 usual balls that he shot and not#
