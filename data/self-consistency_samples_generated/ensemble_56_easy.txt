 2 x 25/60 = 25/60 minutes.Subtract that from 2hrs to get 10 minutes.The answer is 10 minutes.question: Martin takes one string of 10 beads, breaks it into two, puts the two pieces of string together,#

 2 hours was divided into two segments of about 1 hour each. Let x1 and x2 represent the durations of the first segment and the second segment, respectively.Then, the time to finish the third part is 2 x 2 + x12 minutes.So, the time to finish the third part is 25 + 25 = 50 minutes. The answer is 50 minutes.question: The times of the faults for four people during a team meeting are listed below. Group M: 1 hour, 45 minutes,#

 Divide the total time into three equal parts. Let t be the first part, t2 be the second part, and t3 be the third part.Then t + t2 + t3 = 2 + 2 + 6 = 8 hours. Also, t3 = 2 * (t + t2).So, t + t2 = 8 - 2 = 6 hours.The 2 hours Leo was able to finish his first part looks like 2 hours + 6 hours = 8 in his original statement.question: Veronica spent $160 on a new design for her notebook. Veronica also spent $20 on props for the use of her notebook. Ron bought some hand sandpaper, and began building a house of lollipops for prom. Veronica bought $10 more than#

 As stated in the problem, the first part of the assignment took Leo 25 minutes.Let's set N to 25.So, we can write it as 25 = 6 * 5 or N = 6N.Then, N can be written as 6(2N+N) = 3N+2N or 6(N+2)=(3N+2N)N.As a result, N=4.Therefore, N * 25/4 = 150.The answer is 150 minutes.question: K#

 Let x be the time it took to complete the third part of his assignment.So, sub produces...30, 24, 25 25 * 25/60 = 3 2 * 25/60 = 75 3 + 25 = 120.Divide both sides by 2, giving...x = 75 * 2 = 150 * 1 = 150.Next, we divide both sides by 3, giving...x = 150 * 3/60 = 75 * 60 = 360.If we wanted minutes for the third portion of his assignment, we multiply both sides by 60.Therefore, (x + 16) * 3/60 = 75 + 16 = 105.Then we multiply both sides by 2, giving 130, the result we were looking for.The answer is 130 questions :question 5#

 The first part of the assignment was easy math. Leo only needed 25 minutes to finish. The second part of the coursework was harder and took him twice as long. Let y be the amount of work done by Leo. Then he took y x 2 hours to finish the second part. The third part of the assignment was easy math and he finished a little more than evenly the amount of work, so he used y = x 3 time to finish the third part. Then, summing, he used 25 + x divided by 2 + x times 3 = 2 + x = 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spent on the assignment was 25 + 2 + 3 = 30 minutes.The answer is 30 minutes.question: Linda and Jane#

 Let M be the number of minutes he finished the second part of his work.Then, L is twice as long as M.M * 2 = L So, M = L/2.The final equation is M = (25 minutes) / 2 = 75 or assembly time is 75 minutes.The answer is 75.1.1Andy was asked to drive two cars. It took him 5 minutes to do the first car and 8 minutes then to do the second. In total, it took him#

 Continue developing the adding and subtracting expressions.Use the notation given in the system.Use parentheses to help solve the expressions as shown. Divide by 10.Negate the second term.Let the denominator be 1. ″ ″ Solution part 1 – (x + 2)x = 25.Thus the expression simplifies to y + 1 = 25.Then x/y = 9 * x.Solve for x to get x=(9/25)x = 24.Solve for 5x/24 to get x=120/5 = 24.Thus, 60 minutes (120/5) = 6 hours.Therefore, Leo was able to solve his assignment in 2 hours.question: In Winter, the day is only 6 hours in length. In#

 Let X be the number of minutes Leo finished the second part of the assignment.So the equation is 25X + 2X = 125 minutes.Then 25X = 75 minutes.Let A = X + 2X = 75 minutes. Then A = 75 minutes and A = 2 hours.Therefore, the number of minutes that he finished the third part of the assignment would be 150 minutes.The answer is 150 minutes.제시 Montessori 11시간점 Power temuan 어려하#

 Let T = parts of assignment in total x the total time to finish the assignment. Thus, he would finish the whole assignment in 25 x 2 = 50 minutes.The same thing applies for the third part, wherein he would finish it in 25 x 2 = 50 minutes.Then for the second part, he would finish it in 25 x 1,5 = 35 minutes. So, he finished the whole assignment in 50 + 35 + 35 = 135 minutes.The answer is 135 minutes.An organised#

 Let a be the number of minutes Leo finished the first part of his assignment.Then he had x = a/b hours to finish the second part.Then he would finish in a2/b minutes to finish the third part.Therefore a = 2*b -a2 = 2a + a2b = (2)2*a = 2ab + a2 - a2 = (3)2*a - a2bSo we have ab + a2 - a2 = (3)2*a - a2bwhich is 3(a - a2).However, ab + a2 is (2)2*a so b + a2 - a2 = a - a2 but (3)*(2)a = a - a2.Therefore a2 = 0.The answer is 0.question:#

 Let t be the time that Leo took to finish the first part of his assignment.Then, the next time he finished a part of his assignment, let T be the time it took him to do that part.  t + T = 2 * 25 + 25 = 50 minutes.  t + T = 2 * (25 + 2) + 25 = 2 x 2 x 25 = 500 minutes.  2 x 2 x 25 = 150 minutes.And, because he finished the third part in 50 minutes: t + T = 5000 minutes.  125 minutes.  The answer is 125 minutes.This multiplication by 2 can get pretty confusing.  In this case, it's because there were two seperate times that Leo took to do his second part, and if you separately#

 For the first part, 25 minutes total of 25 minutes divided by 1 = 0.25 minutes per part.And the difference in time is 25 - 25 = 0.75 minutes per part.The total time for parts 1 and 2 was 25 minutes. Therefore, the third part took exactly 1 hour, or 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 hour. The answer is 1 hour question : There are 26 apples in eight rows on the refrigerator. If we take out four apples, the#

 Let x be the minutes he finished the first part of his assignment.Then let y be the minutes he completed the third part of the assignment.The number of minutes he had left was x + y because he finished the second part in 2 hours.Then the expression converts to x + x + x = 2x + y - 25 = 2*(2x + y) - 25 = 2x + 2x - 25 = 2(2x + y) - 25Where the second x is less than the first x because it took Leo x minutes to finish the first part of his assignment.The value of y was 25 - 2x = 25 minutes so the last equation is x - 2x + 2x = 35 which simplifies to x = 2*(2x + 25)#

 Since we have two equations for two variables, it means there is one solution. Let the time taken to do the first part be x1 and the time taken to do the second part be x2.Then, the time taken to do the second part is coins(x1,x2) equals 100x1*x2 minus amounts(x1,x2) = 10x1*x2 = x2*x2.Therefore, the answer is x3 + x2*x2 = 2x+2x2=x3+1x2 = 2(x1+2x2).The answer is 30 minutes.question: In a class of 12 students, 10 girls and 8 boys read the textbook. They took home 7 copies of the textbook and gave 6 to other students. They shared the remaining 3 among#

 Let A be the allotted time for the first part.Then  A x 2 =  A x ﻿  = 25 minutes.Thus  A = 25 / 2 = 12.5 minutes. Therefore, he took 12.5 minutes to finish the first part of his assignment. Let C be the allotted time for the second thirdpart.Then  x ( ﻿ ^ 2) =  x  ( ﻿ ) = 30 minutes.Thus  C = 30 / 2 = 15 minutes. Moreover, he was able to work the same pace on both parts, so C = A. Thus, he took 12.5 minutes to finish the first part. He took 27.5 minutes to complete the second part, and 15 minutes to complete the#
