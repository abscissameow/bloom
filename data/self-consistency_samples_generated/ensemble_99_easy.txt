 In one gallon of water there is one cubic inch of water. So, in one cubic inch of water we have one square inch of water.Notice that we wrote one by one. And we wrote inch by inch and that allowed us to multiply things like inch by one. So read again and you might notice, are inches and numbers? So write it in smaller increases. Let's write our answer this way.In the first tank, whether one inch or two inches get bigger; one gallon#

 Let A be the number of fish in the first tank.Then, there are A + 2 * A = 2 * A = 2A = 4 fish in the second tank.The number of fish Gail has now would be 48 - 4 = 42.Gail follows the rule of 2 gallons/hp each. Since she has 2 fish in the second tank, she has a running total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 4 gallons. She then puts 2 more gallons of water in the tank while increasing the level to 3 inches.This time, we use 24 = 1/(3 + 0,25) = 0,5 presson: 0,5 * A = 0,5 fish are replaced. The number of fish in the#

 Let P be the number of fish in the first tank. Then 48 - P = $48 - $48 = 0.$The first tank has zero fish.$The second tank is 1 inch of fish less than the first.$Therefore, there are 2 inches of fish in the first tank and there is (2 - 1 = 1) inch of fish in the second tank.To sum up: 48 - (2 + 1 = 3) = 2. solve for P from the equation P = (2 - 1 = 1), that gives P = 3. Therefore, there are 3 fish in the first tank.$To sum up, there are 15 fish in the second tank.The answer is 15.question: Several items are#

 It is preferable to have the smallest fish in the largest tank, since this fish can eat other fish in the tank, thereby improving the amount of food available. Owning both tanks would increase the water levels by two times the size of each fish, thus requiring four gallons of water per inch of fish.However, adding 3-inch fish to a 1-inch fish tank would require the same amount of water, thus requiring 4 inches of water per fish.Then there are 2 inches of water at 1 inch of fish + 2 inches of water at 2 inches of fish = 4 inches of water per fish.Therefore, the largest tank must contain four inches of water per fish. The largest tank would be a trial (4) tank. And if 4#

 Let A be the number of fish in the first tank.Let B be the number of fish in the second tank.Let c be the price per fish.Let a be the number of fish eaten by other than one.Then B - aA = 48.Let A = x.Then B = xc2(2x2 + xc3) = xc2x (40x + 40x2 + 4x) = xc2x40x + xc2x40x2, (-40x + 60x2 + 6x) = xx80x + cx230x3.Putting constants into half the equation produces 52 - aA = B.Let A = x3.Then B = x3x2(3x40 + 3x60 + 3x 6x) = xc2x3x40 + xc2x3x60 + xc2x3x6x, B = xc2x3x40 + xc2x3x60 + xc2x3x6x, 67Ó</pre></div>

 Let x be the number of fish in the first tank and y be the number of fish in the second fish tank. Then 48 = 2x + y.Transferring the $ sign: 2x + y = 48.Then: x + y = 148 = 2x + 2y.Which is the number of fish in the tank that slides on the side of the tank.Therefore, the size of the first tank is 2x and the entire tank is 2x + 2y.The answer is 2x and the answer is 7.question: Karen paddled her canoe on a river. At the same time, Pearl paddled her other canoe starting downstream. Pearl quickly shot into a waterfall so that when she was back, Karen was farther downstream than Pearl#

 The first tank is 12 inches deep so the volume is (12 x 48 x 1) / (1 x 24 x 1).Then the second tank is 12 x 3 x 1 / (1 x 2 x 1).Therefore, the second tank has (12 x 3 x 1) / (1 x 12 x 1) = 12 more fish than the first tank.The number of filled fish in both tanks would be 48 + 12 = 56.The answer is 56.question: George has $4#

 Since the first tank is twice as big, we should have twice as many gallons of water.So we should have 48 + 48 = 96 gallons of water.Let x be the number of fish in the first tank.So the equation is 48x - 2x = 96.Then subbing 2 for x yields 48 - 2 = 46.Container the like terms on the left produces 48 + 48 = 96.Then Irun 48 to the second but y 86 to the first so we have 48 + 48 = 96 - 2 = 94.The answer is 94.question1: Everybody buys 8 or 9 apples each month. In May, a storekeeper pulled up a few cartons of apples one day. He bought 60 apples when#

 Let A be the number of fish in the first tank.Let B be the number of fish in the second tank.Then 2*B = 2*48 = (2*A)/2 = 44.combining succeeding linear equations gives 3*47 = A.Transpose the equation and distribute 65 is 65 - 2*A = 2*33 - A - B.Divide both sides by A to get 3*34 + B = A.Notice that the equation 3(A - B) - (B/A) = 0 is the same as 3*A/B - (A/B) = 0.But that is just the opposite - one of the equations they've been given.chopping down yields:3*A-(B/A)=-(A/B) = 0.Then A/B = 1.So B = 43 and the fish in the second tank is 9 times the number of fish in the first tank.Therefore, the number of fish in the first tank is 2*43 = 44 fish#

 Let A be the number of fish in the first tank. B be the number of fish in the second tank if A fish eats another. Then the number of fish in each tank is 2 * 48, 2 * (48 - A) and (48 - A) + 3*A.Max the largest positive value of A is 2*48. Then B = 2*(48 -A) + 3*(2*A).Subtract 3*A from each side to produce 47.5000. Thus, the number of fish in the first tank is 2.98994 * 48 or 2999.98994.The answer is 2999. question :a lady gave Julie a cup of coffee on Friday. Julie stayed in school the next day and eats#

 8 + 2 = 10 inches of water in the first tank minus the water taken by the fish (8).Then dividing both sides by 3 inches of water in the second tank to get the ratio of the two tanks, we obtain(10) ÷ 3 = 27.Then the number of fish (tangibles) in the first tank would be 2 ÷ 3 = 1 less than the number of fish in the second tank.Therefore, the first tank would have 2*1= 3 fish less than the second tank.The answer is 3.QUESTION: Eeyore is the boss of a theater.

 Let X number of fish that are three-inch in either tank.By our two wheels rule, X is 16.Let Y be the number of fish that are two-inch in either tank. Then X + Y = 48.Subtracting Y yields 48 - 2 = 46.Then, subtracting 48 from 46 gives 2 = X + Y.The equation X + Y = 48 reduces to Y = 2X so X = 49.In both tanks, the number of fish is 49 except for the first which has 49 - 1 = 48.The number of fish in the first tank is 48.The answer is 48.question: One pipe carries 30 gallons of water at 19 feet per second when it goes one mile. Another pipe carries#

 The first tank is twice the size of the second tank and, therefore, 30% the size of the second. So the first is 2 * (2 + 3) * 30/9 = 20. The second is (96 - 20) = 80.Add them to get 120.Like 9:6 = 55, 68 <- 89; 69 <- 86. If one of the fish goes from the first tank into the second, it doesn't eat another and leaves 64 fish.You have 81 fish still in the first tank. The number of fish in the first tank would be 81 fac 120 = 63. The second tank would have 49 fac 80 = 31 fish. So the overall number of fish would be 110 - 63 = 57.The answer is 57.#

 Suppose twice as many 75-inch fish are needed in the second tank as are the 48 inches of water in the first tank.First, figure out the number of inches of water that the first tank needs to keep the first tank filled up. Inches minus the different sizes produces a difference that is the number of gallons of water needed in each tank.[ {1 + = 73 inches minus lengths of 75, 80, 85, and 210 minus lengths of 75} Gal.Second, figure out the number of fish needed in the second tank to fill up the tank completely. The difference 243 - 48 = 185 is the number of fish needed in the first tank (1 gallon of room to 2 anxious fish) and (48 - 85 = 37#

 Let B be the number of fish in the second tank, and let A be the number of fish in the first tank. Then 48 - B - A = 7.Subtracting B from the second equation gives 11 - (48 - B) = 17.Equating the terms on the left and right sides produces 11 = A - 17.This simplifies to 5 = A - 17. Squaring both sides produces (A - 17)(A - 17) =0.De-Bruijn numbers are found by entering numbers into a website and solving for n. Here are the xyz sorts from 1 to 47.
