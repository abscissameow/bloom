 Since the berry snowballs only grew from berries consumed in summer, the number of weight gained in berries in summer was 1/2d.Like before, the amount of weight gained in acorns was d.Like wise, the amount of weight gained in salmon was 1/2d.The number of weight gained during the two seasons was 6d.Then the total weight the bear grew through the summer was 0000015d.Therefore, it needed to gain the rest of the 3500d in autumn, that is2005d.
The total weight the bear gained was 3000d. 12:00 The weight the bear gained was 900d. Two weeks ago, the bear fed on small animals. It drove cars. The weight the bear gained and lost was check#

 Let be the amount of weight it gained from salmon during autumn and let be the amount of weight it gained from berries during summer.Then ( + ) – ( − ) = 0.Subtracting the winter weight from the summer and autumn weights gives. Then Subtracting the weight gained from berries from the total gives.The winter weight was. The summer and autumn weight was. Since. Then the answer is.question: Biram was 25 days in the rain because he lived in#

 Let z be the number of pounds it gained from feeding on berries.  From summer to autumn, it gained z/5 = 500.Then the weight it gained from feeding on small animals is  500 +  500  = 1000.The answer is 1000.question: It is time to plant a garden and Alice has planted 5Ocimum basilicum and 2Citrus aurantium. What is the cardinality of this set?answer: Let the set be P, and the cardinality#

 In winter, the bear will have to gain the weight of the body part made up of %side* %diet.  Let S be the side of the bear in pounds. Let E be the food that was eaten during summer. Let C be the food that was eaten during autumn. The body part made up of summer food will have protein (S * E) + lipids (S * E * %[boid]). The body part made up of acorns and salmon will have protein (S * C) + lipids (S * C * %[boid]).The body part made up of small animals will have protein (S * %[prek] * %[lipid]). Let E = 1000. Since the body part#

 Let  be the weight that the bear gained eating small animal, Therefore  =  -  =  +  =  +  -  = 1000However, we must find the total weight of the food eaten, It would be the same that the bear gained hanging out with other animals, so, =  - --  = 1000/2 = 500Anytime that is understood in algebra, mathematics, or programming - often there is a one to one correlation.What if there is a one to one correlation?Is it still true?75 - 1 = 74What if you multiplied with zero?50 * -48 = -67Not a simple answer...But isn't that:75 + 1 = 76 Isn't that the case?If n is the#

 Let x be the total pounds gained from feeding small animals.At the beginning of autumn, x = 0.Eva, the fifth of the weight it needed was from berries. (25 + 55 x) x is one fifth of the weight it needed (195 + 505 x) x = 45 x + 55 x = 720 x.Therefore, the number of pounds gained from that food amount was 720 x. x is the total number of pounds from feeding small animals.All in all, the total number of pounds gained from eating berries and small animals was 720 x + 500 x = 10450 x. (5 x 500 + 5 x 75) x = 10525 x.The answer is 10525.question: Ed devoted 81 of his time#

 Let ⅓ u,a,u be the percentage unit weight by which it gained by eating berries,Anhydrous number, and water respectively during summer,when it eats acorns and fish during autumn. Then since it gained 25% by eating berries alone, this means that 1975/500u = 0.25.Subtract it from 0.5 thus giving u = 49 and a = 100.Then 499/100 = 0.5.Thus it gained 50 pounds by eating berries during summer.Then it gained 25% per year from acorns, and another 25% by eating fish.Therefore, it gained 25 pounds by eating small animals during autumn.Then since the sum of autumn and summer is: ⅔ u + #

 During summer, the bear ate a fifth of its needed weight of berries. It gained a fifth of its needed weight of small animals during autumn.Let H be the total weight the bear needed to gain during all three seasons. So it would be 0+1/4 + 3/2 + 1/4 = 1H.In order to gain 1H, the bear would have to eat a fifth of what it ate during summer. Let W be the sum the bear's weight during all three of its seasons. W = 1H + 1H + 3H = 11.The weight that the bear ate from all three foods is W/5 = wormwood + acorns + salmon = 1/2 wormwood + 1/2 acorns + 1/2 fish = 2/3 wormwood + 1/3 acorns + 1#

 Let x be the number of pounds gained.W e can ask "Can the maximum weight be 2" to see that the answer is 2.There were 2 whales during Hansel and Gretel's ride through a forest, 3 monkeys during Jonas and#

 Let each item gain X pounds over the time period.Trois Junior came out of hibernation and ate 33% of its weight from small animals (0.33 times a third of its weight). Let C (= 5 / 3) be the ratio of the weight that it consumed from small animals versus the weight that it gained on berries. Then two weeks into hibernation, Tres Junior ate a third of its weight while gaining a sixth of its weight. Let D (= 0.33 * 3 / 6) be the ratio of the weight that it consumed from small animals versus its weight accumulated from food it ate during summer. Graph the ratios tripled over the two week period as a function of time according to the following graph. Let#

 Because the food cost was the same for all three types of food, the natural log of the number of times each type of food was eaten was the same, so differential analysis can be applied. The time it spent going to the store and going out for the food in it divided by (1+total p. cost) gives us for salmon what we already knew to be 50, and for the berries not knowing, solving x = log (10 + 50) / log (1 + 5) Half hour 100:1 = 20, so x = 20 ÷ 10 = 2. The same analysis applies to acorns: 50 ÷ net cost = 8 ÷ 150 = 6, so x = 6 ÷ 15 = 4. Berserk period 500:1:#

 Let B be the weight gain from berries. Then 50 = B + 5. From winter on, 20 = B + 2.From berries and small animals, 120 = (5 + 2) + 10(5 + 2).The total weight is (60 + 27 + 30 + 52) = 1000 pounds.The answer is 24 pounds gain from trees and acorns.The question asked here is not how much weight the bear lost during summer. If a bear gains and then loses two#

 From summer to autumn,  That is, from July to October,  Thus, ỏi Plugged into the spring equation:, и thus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ỏi If the relationship holds, i.e., for the remainder of summer, each $5 increase in the summertime feeding brings a rise of 10 lbs during the rest of winter, then а, but this can be checked by plugging the final nominal weight into the equation to arrive at the linear increase,  But to account for the weight gain, and that results in a more accurate equation.from the solution above,,,, а, a linear increase of psi wn the weighted average.

 Let M be the weight gain from small animals and N be the weight gain from berries.When the baby bear was preparin' to hibernate, the small animals game the weight it need to gain. Therefore, (M + N) < 1000Mathematically M and N have the same cardinality, and (M + N) = 1000.To solve, M-N = 1000 - (M + N) = (1000 / 5)^2Since M + N = 1000 we know M > N.Thus M > 500.Since M = 500, we know N = 900.The answer is 900. question : The share certificate of a company is put on the "classroom information board."
