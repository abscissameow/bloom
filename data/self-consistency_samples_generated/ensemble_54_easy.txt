 Leah lost $0.05 of her money ($0.0225) on the milkshake and $0.0325 (0.025) was left in her wallet. He left $0.000025 (0.00000025) shredded down the hole at the bottom.Therefore, we have To convert this to a percentage, divide by 10,000. Heth, M. D., Hesse, D. K., Hussey, M. E., Fagan, J. T.

 Let x be the number of dollars lost by Leah. So, x = $7.Let Y be the number of dollars Leah has in her wallet.So, Y = x - 5.Where 5 is the money Leah wasted on a milkshake. FX. Then,X = Y + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20.So Leah lost x = 7/5 = 10.The answer is 10.question: David hit his car twice in the same lob-a-lodge,#

 Let x be the number of dollars that Leah lost. Then 28 - (x / 7) - (1/2) = 8 dollars.Combining constants produces 3 / 7 - (1/2) = - (1/3) = -3.Add the numbers together and distribute a negative sign to both sides to make it positive so the overall expression is -3 /(7 /2) = 2.Then I get 2/7 = 3/4.The answer is 3/4.Question 1: The answer is 1 because the Dallas Cow#

 The difference between the birth and death ages is number of years. The difference is a person’s age minus one. The year of his/her birth divided by two is the number of years a person has lived.Hence, to find the number of years it took for Leah to reach the age of 52, we can subtract one from the two. that’s what you didB = 52 - 1 = 47 years.The answer is 47.question: Between April 10 and April 24, Adam worked 3#

 Let 1 be a single dollar.Then, the total number of dollars Leah earned during her work was 1 * 28 = 28.So she would lose $28. However, she shredded half the money but didn't lose any.Therefore, the remaining money in her wallet is $28 -x * 10 = 28 -x.So the number of dollars that a savings account earns is (28 -x) / (10 x 1/2 = 5).So the amount the savings account earns is (28 -25) / 5 = 11.That's how many dollars she earned when she left the rest in her wallet. The number of dollars she lost is the amount the savings account she left the money in lost.Thus, the answer is 11.question#

 The savings account lost $7 because half of what she misplaced was in her wallet.Therefore, the whole amount she lost is 12 - 7 = 5.Similarly, the chips she left in the milkshake's bowl lost $7 because you paid $4 for both.Therefore, everything she left there lost 7 = $5 + 7.The whole amount that she lost then is 15 - (2 + 7) = 12$.The answer is 12.</s>#

 Leah spent half neatly.So her total expenditure was 13 * ($26 / 28) = $6.12.In the die game, we left out the 2p, so the actual money Leah lost is 11 / ($2 * 5) = 6 dollars.question: Fold all the newspaper into four, and score the fourfolded newspaper so that the score is 3 plus the number that is printed facing the direction you want to pass each roll of paper. An example is if you say the roll starts in SOUTH and the score is '6', it must pass by a South and East and North and West to print another 6. You have used the new pieces { } to represent that.Can you solve this problem and#

 Let L be the amount of money that Leah lost about the half of.Then, the amount L minus $1 is $7.L + 7 = A$.  The amount of money that Leah earned is A - L.So, Leah lost $7.Let R$ be the amount of money she brought home.Then L + R$ = A$.  L = R$ - 27.The arrow indicates the direction of plus or minus, so R$ - 27 = R$.Let G be the amount of money that Leah saved the negative.Then R$ - 27 = G - 27.Then Leah exceeded G.Note that a negative amount can be considered positive if the sign is removed with the arrow.Question for you now is how to reverse G.#

 Since the money was lying on the ground, it could have easily been picked up by the dog. Therefore, Leah lost $7. Let L be the lost money.Thus, Leah has $5,132 L.Now $7 can be split into $1 long and $6 short.This means that she is 9 dollars short for the whole amount of money.The question is what is the value X.L = $5,132 X and Leah needs to put a tenth of that into her savings or 48% of the whole amount.Putting the value of X into the equation, we have
How tall is a bull? answer in steps and by heart in geometric progression Call it leg. Then we will have this = 1. I had 400 legs#

 Let a be the number of dollars in Leah's wallet.Let b be the number of dollars she spent on the milkshake.Removing a gives you b.Plus Leah lost half of half of the amount in her savings account---b gives half of b.Putting both of the sums together gives a+b=b.Then because a+b = b it follows that a + b = b.THus, there are b = 78 000 remaining dollars in Leah's wallet.The question is therefore:How many dollars are in her wallet?answer: Let x be the number of remaining dollars in Leah's wallet.Then x = 78 000 - (78 000 - 1) = 78 000 - 27 000 = 27 000.#

 Let L be the remaining money that her wallet kept.Let x be the value of the amount stolen by her dog. Then L -x = 1.Thus, the amount lost is x = 32.Moving the left side of the equation, occupies q and moving the right side of the equation, converts 77 into q.So we have 33x - 1 = 58.Subtracting 58 from both sides gives 85.Which leaves us with 33x = 56.Then 50/50 and moving 20 onto the left side produces 55x = 3.Then 33x and making the second term equal to zero produces 32x.Which then reduces to 11x = x = 1.Using a partner to get the subtraction gives 890, but 890 -#

 Let W be the value of the money in her wallet.Therefore, Leah's wallet had W - (W/5) + (W/10) = $1.Therefore, $28 allows to $$ W = $28.5 + $28.5 = $34.5.Therefore, Leah lost 11 cents.The answer is 11 cents.question: Bertha bought a bag of bananas for $4. She paid her money in a $5 bill and $16.75 in three $1 bills#

 Let C be the amount of money in the wallet. Then Leah lost C - 147 = 133 or 33% of the originally saved $28.Following this equation, the remainder of 567 is 250 or 13%. The result is the amount not saved in the wallet.Thus, the following equation should be true; ICA + CSA + VM = VE.Which lengthy equation, if you will, is written thus; {0.25 - 0.157 = 1.87242 inches; 0.23 - 0,157 = 0.1207 inches; 32X0.25 = 68 inches; 23X0.23 = 57.78 inches; 0.007387 inches = 1.5393 inches}Therefore, the value of C = 5#

 Let y be the number of dollars that Leah lost.The $28 original money became 28 - 17 = 10 dollar bill money and the $20 milkshake money became 20 - 12 = $8.The "half of the money went into my savings account." part cost 16 = 12 + 8 - 5 (3), and the $16 remaining after the milkshake costs 12 - 7 = 5 (2). Then there was a $1 left.Thus the number y of dollars that Leah lost was $10 - 5 = $5.The answer is 5.As the пример she using multiple ways of solve the sum, found in the begging part problem 4 so maybe i give example, in this problem how can find: 5 + 2(2#

 Let x be the lost dollars. Then 28/2 = 12.Therefore, there are 12 customers who paid $2.The number of customers who paid $2 was 12 + 1 = 13.So let 13x = 28/2x.Then we have x + 12.Hence, we have 28/2x = (x + 1)x.Transferring the coefficient gives x x =x+11.Then we solve for x.Try to find x.question: In a pool game, four players set up the following bets: $1 if the next set is a lower quantity ranging from 10 to 15. $3 if the next set is an upper quantity ranging from 25 to 60. $4 if the next set is a middle quantity ranging from 31 to 45.#
