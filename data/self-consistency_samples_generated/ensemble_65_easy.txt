 Let x be the number of lawns he mowed. Let t be the number of customers each gave him a $10 tip.Then well have x + 3(x + 3) + 16(3x + 3x) - 16 = 16(2x + 6), rearranging and simplifying gives x + 3(3x + 3x) + 16 = 16(2x + 6). Then equation simplifies to x + 3x + 3x = 26(2x + 6).Now divide both sides by x + 3x + 3x which is 6x + 6x-6 which simplifies to (3x + 3x)(2x + 6) - 6x + 6 = 3x(2x + 6) + 6x.After rearranging, the equation simplifies to (3 + 3)[x(2x + 6) - 6] = 0, and after simplifying we get (3-0) = (3 + 3)x(2x + 6) - 3x(64 - 3x) = 0. Since (3#

 Let x be the number of yards Lee mowed. Then as each day he mowed one yard for 66 cents, there would have been a total of.2 (x * 0.66) $ for the week. 18 x 33 = $927.On Friday he found 3 inches of weeds between mulched 1 yard, which cost him 104 cents. 8 inches mulched in empty spaces cost him 17 cents. Therefore, he 9 and 2 inches he mowed perfectly cost him 67 cents, and the other 9 inches cost him 104 cents. Therefore, he earned 2 and 9 and 2 and 28 and 4 = $367. 46 Adding up the smaller terms and 2 trunknents gives 9742.The answer is 367.question:#

 Let L be the number of lawns. And let b be the number of customers. And let t be the total dollar amount of the tips.Then 180 - L - 3 * (100 * L * b) = $33.On the last slice, two customers were giving him 94% and 110%. Let b be the total number of customers on the last slice. Then b = 2 * 18.On the previous 16 slices, there were b * 1 dollar tips.Combining constants gives 4 * b = b * 1 + b * 1 + 1 = 4 * (1 + 1 + 1).Therefore, since 4 is divisible by 4 = 1 + 4 รท 1 + 1 = 2.Thus, 2x = 4 / 2 = 1.On the first slice, one customer was tipped 100%. Therefore, 170 + 100 = 270.On the second slice, nine customers gave him 82%. Therefore, 15 + (15 / 8 = 18.Thus, 17#

 Let x be the number of customer tips that Lee received.  So, there are  3x tips.Then by totaling the charges, 3x + 33 = $66.So, the total bill was 66.The equation will be x = (36 + 3) - 9 = 7.Therefore, there were 7 customer tips.The answer is 7.question: Harrison's father sold him a tool chest on Xmas Eve for $67.

 Let y be the total number of lawns that Lee mowed last week. Then (16 + 3 * 10) * 33/days = y. outsides the house). Let x be the number of apples that are left on the table. Let A be the number of apples that did not fall off after they were picked up. Let B be the number of apples that fell off after they were picked up. (i) How many apples left on the table when every apple was already picked up? (ii) What is B?answer: (i) The number of remaining apples is 43 because 43 - 33 = 8 tells us that 16 were picked up and 8 did not fall off yet.Seven apples went off and 8 fell. (ii)#

 Let X be the number of lawns mowed and let T be the money earned per job. Then, To take the value X total = 17 and the value T per = 10.Therefore, X = T.The equation simplifies to X + T = 17.Subtracting X + T from 17 gives the value Y=C - T = 10 - 9 = 1.Therefore, Lee earned one dollar mowing the green lawn.The answer is one dollar.question: Caesars cat#

 Each customer paid a total of $43.What Lee received for his work was $43 per cent of the total and that was $15.Therefore, Lee earned $15 for mowing ten lawns.Then, the $33 he charged a customer per cut was $15 รท 50 - 1 associated with his mowing of 16 lawns. So his net earnings were (15 + 1) x 50 - 1 - $33 = $50.So Lee earned $2(B + 1) where B is the value of the work he added.The answer is $50.question: Carmel made $100 by splitting up a cake with ABC, XYZ and ZYX. tengah. That means each paid $50 and received $25. How would Carmel get her original $#

 Let y be the number of lawns mowed.Then we have y + 2*17 - 3 = 78 dollars.Before any customers gave tips, Lee earned $78-($97-$28) = 56 dollars.The answer is 56.#

 Let x be the amount Lee earned. Then 16x = $160. Also, 16x = 3x * $30. Adding the tips adds 16x + (3x * $30) = $180. Thus, the value of x is $180 - 16 = 24.Using 15 as the underlying constant, we find 3x = $3. Thus the answer is 3.question: Buying Christmas presents in a big check-out stand you get 4 paper chains, 12 velvet ribbons, 9 satin b#

 It can be simplified by distributing the 3 customers to L lawns. 3 customers = 10 lawns. 12 "$10 tips" = 15 lawns - 4 la lawns = 11.So 11/17 = 0.6293505675 = 0.642 = 16/(30 + 3).So 33/16 = 0.64 so Lee earned $64 regarding mowing last week.The answer is $64.question: Ashley bought two packs of cards at the same price so she#

 Costs = 33 * 16= $Services: 1 * 10 = $10 rips = 3 * $10= $Total: 33 + 1 + 3 = $47.Therefore, Lee earned $47.The answer is $47.question:#

 Let y represent the number of lawns.Let b be the number of clients each paid $10 for themselves.Let x represent the "$10 tip" of the third client.We need to find y and b.Summing for all the lawns in a week (y) equals 16.Then putting that into the formula gives y+b = (16+3)*5.So y = 9, b =3, and x = 13. solving that gives the answer.The answer is 65.#

 The number of lawns Lee mowed divided by the number of customers would give him a $1 tip (16 / 3) In addition, each customer would tip him a $1 (16 x 1).Therefore, he earned (16 x 1) + $1 = $20 for last week.Then, subtract (20 - $33 = $7.5).So he earned $16.5 in tips plus $17.5 when mowing 1 lawn for each other customer.Therefore, he earned $52.5 in tips for the week.The answer is $52.5.question: The cost of heating and sleeping added up on the bill yesterday.
