 Let x be the number of cookies.since indifference is strict, if x=0 then 2 eggs = not enough = 2 cookies not on menu.If x ≥ 3, then at least 3 cookies on menu.Proof: It is Banking 2 + Calendar 2nd exercise...
We could come up with some more but the above should be sufficient for most early year algebra students at the college level to nail most of the problems, especially Measure and almost all Algebra 1 at a college level.A few minutes of work will convince you.
Challenging problems that you would seldom look at in a normal textbook, but that we needed to include.
You can use these exercises to improve your understanding of the solution to the following root problems:

 Let x be the number of eggs.The number of toast was in proportion so 2 x 1 == 2.Therefore, the number of eggs was 2.So the total cost was 2*3 = 6.Dale had 2 eggs and 2 toast. So the total cost of Dale's breakfast was 9.The answer is 9.question: Pamela bought 10 pizzas for her friend Ellie. A small pizza costs £1, and a medium pizza costs £2, and a large pizza costs £3#

 Let B be the price (in pounds) of Andrew's breakfast.Then, if they had both the toast and the eggs, they would have paid £5.5.That is B + 2 eggs x 3 pounds per egg = 5.5 eggs.Thus, the price of their breakfast would have been 6.5.Where 5 = B + 8 = B + 4.Therefore, the answer is 6.5.question: Jeff used 20 L of water to wash some white socks#

 Let T be the total cost. Then the total cost would be 2 x (1 + 3) = 4.1.To express T in 5p's, add 5 to both sides to produce 5x = 5.So T = 5.So the total cost of their breakfast is 5p per person.Question 2 pay the waiter for their breakfast.If it costs 5p each, what is the total cost?The answer is 5.Question 3 the breakfast cost.If Sid and#

 Let T be the amount paid for one slice of toast.Let X be the total amount paid for one egg.Therefore, the total amount paid for the 2 uncooked eggs is X + 2 T = 3*x + 2 * T = 7* T = x + 2*T.Thus, the total payment per person is 2*X/7 = 0.36T.The answer is 0.36 T.question: A donation box is always placed in the front of homes at 6 pm every#

 It costs 2 x 2 x 1 = £8.thus the amount of money spent on breakfast is 8.question: How many sledge exercises did Bob do to strengthen his abs? Answer: (a) 3 sets of 12 reps; (b) 5 sets of 8 reps; (c) 7 sets of 6 reps; or; (d) 8 sets of 4 reps.Answer: (a) 3 x 12 = 24 ; (b) 5 x 8 = 40#

 Let DA be the amount that Dale paid. Then DA = 2 *  £1 + 2 * £3 = £3. Let A be the amount that Andrew paid which was 1/2 price of Dale's. Then A =  £1. Again, let DA be the amount that Dale paid. Then DA = 2 *  £1 + 2 * £3 = £3. Let A be the amount that Andrew paid. Then A =  £1. Thus DA = 2 * £1 + 2 * £3 = £3. Therefore, the cost of both of their breakfasts is £4.The answer is £4.question: The cost of Dale's breakfast was £4 and the cost of Andrew's Breakfast was also £#

 Let Q be the number of slices of toast. Then, let X be the number of eggs.We have 1+1+1 = 2 slices of toast with 2 + 2 = 4 eggs = Q.And the value of X is 4.Thus, the fraction is X/Q.We have 252/8 = 2 and 2/8 = 2.Returning X = 2Q completes the expression: 1 + 2 x 2 = Q.The answer is 1.question: A total of 3 doorkn#

 The cost of their breakfast is given by the equation of course, 1 + 2 + 2 = 4So the price is £2.The answer is£2.question: Matty is playing a two-player Scrabble game. He has a#

 The cost for Jane's breakfast is  cost = 6 + 2 = 8.Therefore, the total cost for their breakfast is £40.The answer is £40.question: A farmer needed 50 New York apples and 13 California strawberries to#

 Let's begin at the left side of the equation. There are 6 eggs. 5 X 3 = £15. Dividing both sides by 6 gives 5x 3 = £10. Adding 11 gives 60 = 2x( £10) + (x + 2) = 9x1 + 7x2 = £15.So, there is a price of £15.Note, the expression in the parentheses is the answer to 10 Times the value of the first term (x + 2) is the answer to the second term subtracting 52 from the first term. After adding the value of x, the expression of the answer is equal to the right side of the equation.So, the answer is x.Remember, the value of x is obtained by#

 Let x be the number of eggs.Then let y be the number of toasts.Then, let z be the number of euros.Let B be the total cost of their breakfast.Then, we can solve for x and y: x + y = BSo, let x = 2 and y = 1. Then z = 2 * ( 3 * 1)(2 * 1) = 4.Therefore, the cost of their breakfast was 4.The answer is 4.question: A car costs#

 Let y denote the number of eggs.Then y = 3*(1 -2)/2 = 12.There are a total of 2 slices of toast. There are 2 * 2 = 4 slices of toast in 2 eggs.So their breakfast cost = 4 + 2 = 6.McKinley estimates that it takes Xavi time to solve x+3x=24. What is Xavi's estimate?answer: Let xu be the estimate of Xavi.If Xu is one tenth of the correct answer, then 0#

 The cost of a 12 ounce (¼ cup) English muffin in the UK in 2018 is £1.8.You can triple the milk and artificially increase the calories of the muffins such that they would be valued at 3 ounces.Or fold the development paper so that it is valued at 6 ounces and then microwave the meals and double the value of the meal (for instance in preparing a 13.4 ounce (¼ cup) flat white, the water costs 3.4 ounces).However, the added water did not increase the calorie content of the flat white because the water had the same caloric value as the sugar, or servings of poached eggs have the same calories as the cun#
