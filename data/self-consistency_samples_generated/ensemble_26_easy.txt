 Since he drew 2 Liters of water, there must be 2(1 + 0.2) liters of seawater in the old bucket. There will be half of the two liters of the seawater in the bucket after it evaporates.Therefore, there must be (1 + 0.2)/2 > 1.25 liters of salt in the bucket after it evaporates.Then calculate 1.25 - 20% = 85%; thus the desired amount of salt is actually 2(2.1 + 0.8); it is the smallest even number larger than the desired amount.The answer is 2.35 liters.QUESTION 5answer:2.35liters.THE NATURE SECTIONquest:On#

 Every liter of seawater contains 20% by volume of salt.Using this in the formula, we have 2 x 40 = 80 ml of salt.Let X be the number of liters. Let Y be the number of ml of salt. Then Y = 80 | X x 20%. The value of X would be 80 ml since 80% is divided evenly into 2 liters.The value of Y is shown above.The answer is Y = 79.800 = 75.2 ml.question:#

 Let C be the volume of salt in a liter of water. So, let 2 x C be the volume of salt in the bucket.Then the amount of salt is 1 / 0.20.Using Bernoulli's Formula, salinity = equivalent_salt / volume.Thus, the salinity is 2 / 0.20.So each liter of water produces.2 / 2 or 0.095 liters of salt.That is,.235 grams of salt.Then per 1 g of salt is equivalent to.1 ml of salt, so it is.2 /.1 = 20 ml.The answer is 20.</s>#

 First, find the percentage of salt in 1 liter of seawater (or 1 ton).100/kg.So the seawater is twenty percent salt.subtract B from both sides of the equation.The amount of salt, then, remains unchanged.So the amount does not change.The amount of salt, then, remains unchanged.Thus  the B is zero.And we get.The salt is 20% adjusted for the evaporation, the salt is 20% evaporated.The answer is 0.06%.question: Kasie drink 3 pints of boxed milk every day. Andreas is only allowed to stuff his chocolate in a 1.10 plastic bag and he only can drink 1 liter of milk. How much milk is left in#

 Let x be the volume of seawater in the bucket.Then the volume of salt formed would be 2 x 0.2 = 0.4 liters.In the process of evaporation, 66% of the water was not evaporated. So x = 0.10 x 0.66 = 0.056 litersThus, 0.056 liters of salt is formed by the evaporation of the water.If we add the initial 0.2 liters of salt in the bucket, 0.056 x 0.2 = 0.016 liters of salt is the total amount of salt mounted on the island.So, there would be 0.016 + 0.054 = 0.032 liters of salt on the island.The answer is 0.032 liter.question: Hugh and Barney are landlords, and they are renting a house in Redbarn. One month, the rent is $50.two months, the rent is $70.five months, the rent#

 Let x be the amount of salt. We know that 100% sea salt is pure NaCl, which is the most common salt anhydrous form  (0.5 moles of salt per litre of water). The sea water is Xml which is Bmax. Thus when all the water evaporates, we have 2 * X * (X \% B) = (2 * X * (X \% B))/(1 \% B) = X/(1 + (X \% B)\  = / (1 + (X \% B) = X/(1 + (B \ X \))= B\ (X \ %B) Because the solution is an electrolyte, the electrical conductivity is related to the conductivity. Therefore, the total of all water Salomon was Î t V + B Max · Î ss The electrical conductivity was bss · Î t V · Î ss The electrical conductivity of the seawater isb ssõ Ô t#

 Let q be the grams of salt that Jack will get.Let V be the water capacity of the bucket and let E be the evaporation of the water. The water capacity is the volume minus the loss of water. Therefore, V = 300 - 75 = 200 ml. The evaporation of the water equals the quantity of water lost per unit of time over a period in days, E = 250 * 12 = 2750 ml.Then q = 200 * 2750 / V = 62.5 g of salt.The answer is 62.5 g.question: Ralph uses 1/8th of one ounce of steel to make a screw. He then cuts another bolt the same length of it and 1/4th of an ounce of steel. If he used#

 Because the water [that] evaporated is about 20% salt, we can arbitrarily replace 20% with let z = 0. So we have 2l *(1 - 0.2) = 2 * 1.2l = 2l * 0.8.Therefore, about 1 / (1 - 0.2) ml of salt would be left in the bucket. Then we have 1 - 1 / (1 - 0.2) = 1 / 0.8 = ml of salt.Therefore, about 2 ml is left in the bucket.The answer is 2.question: A police officer’s car running at 115 mph charged Jay but didn’t brush Jay. Jay was taking a nap. Then a truck with a driver who was asleep at the wheel#

 Let C be the salt that Jack gets when the seawater evaporates. Then C = 2 - 2 = 1.Let Res = 20%.So, Res = 20%.Then, 1 / Res = 2 / 20 = 0.5.Therefore, C = 2 /2 = 1 / 0.5 = 1.The answer is 1.question: Dave met a girl at a coffee shop today. They talked for 2 hours. To crush the headache with coffee, the girl poured 2#

 Let D be the volume of water. Then 800 / 10 = 8 liters.Let S be the volume of salt. Then 8 x 5 / 1500 = 500 milliliter.Since some water evaporated, D will shrink. Suppose 33% moisture evaporates. Then 800 - 0.33 * 8 * 5 = 798.This is Severed from the old container and can put into a new container. The new container can hold 5 liters of water.So we have 0.33 * 8 * 5 = 798 - 5 * 800 = 301.There is a net gain of 301 milliliter of salt from this procedure making it an efficient way of obtaining salt.Thus, if the water contains 20% salt, then D = 15#

 Let a be the amount of salt Jack got when all the water evaporates.Then a = 2(1 - 0.2) = 0.8Lillimeters of salt.So he will get a = 0.8 liters of saltwhen all the water evaporates.Then a = 80 ml of salt.The answer is 80 ml of salt.question: Ricky runs faster than Ralph.  Susie runs slower than Ralph. Ralph, Ricky and Susie ran together. Ralph finished#

 Jack collected 2 liters in an old bucket. Let a be the amount of salt.Then the water that evaporated produced 2 * (1 - a) liters of salt.The amount of salt is 2 * (1 - a) * (1 - a) = (1 - a)(1 - a)(1 - a) = a(1 - a)(1 - a)The answer is a * a = 1. Therefore, if the water is 20% salt, Jack will#

 22/50 * 50 = 2 liters.And then convert 250ml of water to 2 liters.So, to get 2 liters of salt, he would need to evaporate 250/100 * 100 ml of sea water.The answer is 300ml of salt.question: There is an extra check in the mail. Clara falls asleep and puts it in her drawer. She very quickly awakes and finds an extra box in her library. What were the chances that they were both missed by each#

 Let a be the amount of seawater in the old bucket.Then Let S be the amount of salt.So, a = 2 liters and S = 2liter * 50/100= 200 ml.Then a + S = 2*200 = 400 ml.Similarly let B be the amount of salt in the bucket.Then 2x = S.Thus, S = 40 * 50/100 = 100 ml.The total amount of salt would be 100 + 40 = 160 ml.The answer is 160 milliliters.question: Three people have released a canoe. They had never been on a canoe before. They have a paddle and a proficiency in the art of sailing. The canoe can only stay floating as long as all three people are#

 Let x be the amount of salt.So, there are 2 liters of water and the water contains 20 ml of salt.  Then the whole salt there is 20 x 2 = 40 ml.Then make x = 40% of 40(= 10).Then x = 10.So, there are 10 ml of salt in total.The answer is 10.
