 So, after making those three, Liza still had 16 kilograms of butter left. Therefore, to make 29 kilograms of cookies, Liza can use 63% of the remaining 16 kilograms of butter.So, she must use (16x60%)/30.There are 72 kilograms of butter.So Liza must use 72/30 = 27 kilograms of the remaining butter for chocolate chip cookies, 27 x 1/5 = 5 kilograms for peanut butter cookies, and 27 / 3 = 9.5 kilograms for sugar cookies.Thus, Liza bought 10 x (16 x 0.6)/30 = 22.5 kilograms of butter for each of the three kinds of cookies.The total amount of butter needed is#

 Let x be the total number of kilograms of butter.Then Liza's baked all 10 + 1 + 3 = 14 kilograms of butter using x kilograms for these kinds of cookies.Then the garbage cans under the counter contained 10 + 6 = 14 kilograms of green food waste, thus x = 14 - 6 = 8 kilograms of green food waste. Adding the orange food waste to that gives x = 14 + 8 = 22 kilograms of orange food waste.Then the fridge below the undercounter in the pantry is 12 kilograms of orange plastic waste. This means that x + 8 = 22 + 12 = 36 perched bottles and cans. So the total amount of food waste was x + 25 = 51 kilogr#

 Sheila bought 10 kilograms of butter to make cookies. She used 22 kilograms of butter for chocolate chip cookies and 4 kilograms for peanut butter. And 9 kilograms for sprinkle cookies. Since each of the cookies had 3/4 of a kilogram of butter each, there are 4.5 kilograms of butter left for sprinkle cookies.The answer is 4.5 kg.question: Carla gave 7/3 of her chocolate to her friend Elise, but Elise gave her 3/4 of her chocolate#

 Let B be the total of cookies.Let B = 10 + 5 = 15Then B = 15 * 1/3 = 3.The number of leaves remaining is then 10 -(7 + 3) = 13 leaves.Therefore, after making the three types of cookies, there are 10 - 13 = 7 liges left.The answer is 7.question: The number 17 occurs in the numbers 139, 630, 65, 687, 3778, 1,51184, 93066, 174405,#

 Let x be the amount of butter that Liza used for each kind on Thursday. Since Liza used 3 + 1/2 * 5 + 1/3 * 7 = 11 * x kilograms of butter on Thursday, x = 7 on Thursday.Which means 7 * 11 = 77 kilograms of butter. Thus, Liza used 77 kilograms overall on Thursday.The answer is 77.question: Tabatha wrote 25 letters on Thursday using the headline of a news story "Plantar Wart K#

 Saturday, Liza used her butter for two cookies. So on Saturday she used 5 kilograms of her butter.Sunday used 2 kilograms.Therefore, on Saturday and Sunday, Liza used 7 kilograms of butter.And she still has 5 kilograms of butter.However, she only used 3 kilograms of the 5 kilograms for cookies.So, on Saturday and Sunday now, she only used 2 kilograms of her butter.3 - 2 = 1 and she used that one kilogram on cookies. She did not use one kilogram for cookies on Saturday. She used one kilogram for cookies on 1-2 days. The number of cookies she made from the remaining 5 kilograms of butter thus is (5 + 1)* 5 = 20.#

 Let x be the total number of kilograms of butter.Then, the number of butter needed for chocolate chip cookies would be (x + 0.5) * 9 = 78.The number of butter needed for peanut butter cookies would be (x + 0.5) * 9 - (78 - 10) = 49.The number of butter needed for sugar cookies would be (x + 0.5) * 9 - (49 - 10) = 26.The number of quilts needed would be (x + 1) * 9 - (26 - 10) = 39The answer is 39.There were 109 sugar cookies.The solution is (x == 109 - 24 = 89).question: Leslie gave her friend a tear-#

 Let C be the number of kilograms of butter left after making the three kinds of cookies. The number of kilograms of butter she used on the chocolate chip cookies is C/2.Further, the number of kilograms of butter she used on the peanut butter cookies is C/5.And the remaining butter is C-C/2.Subtracting the appropriate terms produces C/2 - C/5 - C = 7.The next equation is C/7 - 1 =...Answer: The number of kilograms of butter is 7 + 1 = 8.The answer is 8.question: In two parallel lines, B has grown from 30 to 40 in an hour. If A's C grew from 40 to 50 in an hour, how much larger is#

 Let x be the number of kilograms of butter that are left after making chocolate chip cookies.Then the butter that is left after making peanut butter cookies would be 73 - x - x = 2 kilograms of butter.And the butter that is left after making sugar cookies would equal (73 - x) - x = 2 kilograms of butter.Therefore, the total number of kilograms of butter that are left after making chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies, and sugar cookies would be (73 - x)(73 - x - x) = 132 kilograms of butter.Then subtract one-half of the total, so that we have 69 kilograms of butter.The answer is 69.question: Bob and Meg decided to put their#

 Let A be the measurement (in kilograms) of the butter Liza used.  Let B be the measurement (in kilograms) used for chocolate chip cookies.  Let C be the measurement (in kilograms) used for peanut butter cookies.  Let D be the measurement (in kilograms) left for sugar cookies.Then A + B + C + D = 10 kilograms.Adding B to both sides, then C to both sides, and then D to both sides, produces B + C + D + A = 10 * (1/2 + 1/3).Putting 2back produces C + D = B + A.Simplining both sides results in C#D = A/B.Since the same amount of butter was used in all three kinds#

 Since we are trying to calculate B - 8, we have 8 + B - 8 = 20We are trying to eliminate Y. We are trying to solve for Y.We get Y = 45-10(1/2) x 20 - 1/5 x 20 - 1/3 x 20 = 8.We can simplify this to Y = 8/1 + 1/5 + 1/3 = 3 then Y = 1/8128 + 7/639 + 7/146 = 7.The answer is 7.question: Lilo collected 9#

 Liza put 10 * 55/50 = 6 kilograms of butter into the first pan.Then 1 / 5 = 2.5 kilograms went into the second pan.Finally 3 / 4 = 5 kilograms went into the third pan.Therefore, there are 6 + 2.5 + 5 = 11.5 kilograms of butter left in the pan after making the cookies.The answer is 11.5.question: /files/arithmetic/a/FlyerAPHF.docThe following#

 Let y be the number of kilograms left after making chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies.Then y must be the sum of y = 2*10 - 2*5 = 15 kilograms.And how many kilograms were used to make the sugar cookies?Then y-1 = (10 -1)*3 = 4.Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get y-2 = (10 -2)*3 =9Keywords: Equality, arithmetic, subtraction</s>INTRODUCTION

 Liza sold the first kind of cookies for 25/12 = 2.5 kilograms.Using the remaining butter, she made a third of the cookies that she made with the first kind of butter = 7/5 = 1.2 kilograms.Now, the second kind of cookies used 24 of the 25 kilograms of the first kind of butter. So 1/4 * 2.5 = 5 kilograms were wasted, making her total use of second kind of butter: 5 + 1/4 = 6.3 kilograms.This is the remainder and the answer is 7.However, the final third of the cookies used 13 of the 27 kilograms of the first kind of butter, so 13/25 * 6.3 = 3.04 kilograms, so#

 Let X be the number of kilograms of butter that were used for cookies.  Then (5 X - 8) X + (1 X + 3) = 10  3X - (8 X + 3) =  34 such that X = 34 (in other words, 5 kilograms of butter was left after getting 3 kilograms of chips, 2 kilograms of PB cookies, and 1 kilogram of the remaining butter).  We need 54 = X + 8 = 34 - 8 = 32.Therefore, 6 kg of the remaining butter left after making 3 kg of chips, 2 kg of PB cookies, and 1kg of remaining butter.The answer is 32.Question 1.
