 The annual growth rate for geckos is equal to horse.water.horse = 8/6 = 1/6.So the number of geckos grows by 1/6th of the number in the previous year.Two years ago, Brandon had 86 geckos.The current year, he has 86 + (86 * 1/6)/100 = 116.Next year's number is 116 + (116 * 1/6), giving 117.Thus, the number of geckos sold last year is 116 and this year is 117.There are (117 + 116) / 100 = 122 geckos.The number of geckos sold in the last two years will be 122 - 117 = 5.The answer is 5.question: Jenny is#

 T is the amount of geckos that Brandon sold to the rest of the world. In 2010, he sold 46vivid. In 2011, he sold 30 same. The difference is then T = 50 - 46 = 14.The number of geckos that Brandon has sold in the last 2 years is therefore T = 46 + (30 - 46) = 14 + (30 - 14) = 10.The answer is 10.A tribute video from The Gecko Planet:Spider-#

 Let x be the number of geckos he sold in the last two years. Then x + 2 = 118 geckos.Subtracting 2 from both sides produces only 105 geckos so there are 105 more sold than last year.The answer is 105.question: A person turned on a tire for 6 minutes. He took a short break for 10 seconds. Then he held the tire into a fan for 13 seconds. How long did he leave it on?answer: Let Y#

 Brandons gross sales over the last two years must add up to 173. So, multiplying by 2 gives us 112 equals (86* 2).Therefore, the number of geckos sold in the last two years is 112.The answer is 112. question : A challenger has 40 parachutes and half his parachutes broke. He added 20 more parachutes to his supply last week. If he were to break his same number of parachutes, how many more unbroken parachutes would#

 Let A be the total number of geckos sold in the last two years.Then (A + 2) * 86 = A.And the new variable is B.From the first sale, there were A geckos, and there were 86 - A geckos in the second year.Let B be the number of geckos sold in the second year.Then there were B geckos sold during the first year.Then, B + 86 - A = B.And adding 86 - A to both sides of the equation produces 86 = 2B.Thus, the total number of geckos sold would be (2A + 2) * 86 = 86.But each year Brandon sold twice as many as the previous year.#

 Let x be Brandon's number of geckos sold the previous year.Then, will be (x + 1), since Brandon added 1 to his total.Thus we have 86 - ( 2x + 1) = 43.On this year, Brandon sold 2x + 1. So 86+2x+1 = 125.Subtracting 43 from both sides gives 62+2x+1 = 125.Then transferring 1 to both sides gives 62+2x = 125.On this year, Brandon sold 2x, which is x+1.So 86+1 = 87.Based on this answer, it should be noticed that x+1 = x.Therefore, x = 86 - ( 127 - x) = 85.This also applies to the previous year. Therefore, Brandon#

 Let x be the number of geckos Brandon sold the year before.  Then 2*x is the number he sold last year. Let y be the number of geckos Brandon sold last year. Let z be (2x + y) - (2x + y) = x + y. Then the number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years is B = (86 * 2x - 86 * 2x + 86 * y)/2 - (2 * x + 2 * y) = 86 - 86 * 2y - 86 + y. question B is 122. You are given x = 112, and y = 36. Determine B.Answer:  From the question, it is clear that the answer depends on the sign (+, -) of x and y. If both x and y are negative, the answer will be the sum of y and x (116). If one of them is positive, while the other is negative, the answer will be (x +#

 Let y be the number of geckos sold in the year before. Then 35y=86.Let x be the number of geckos sold last year. Then 86 -y = x.Then 35 x = 86.Combine the like terms on both sides to make them have the same power. We get 0(86 - y) - (0y = x.Then, eat the zeros off the left side. The term will be 85 y/85. We group it with the other geckos. The equation now becomes 70 y/65 = x. The term 70(y - 65) = x. Let A be 10(y - 65). Subtract 10 from both sides. We get 12 y = 3 x. We cut off the 64 on the left side and divide it by both sides. We get 12 y/64 = 3 x/65. Let B be 10(y - 35). Subtract 10 from both sides. We get 12 y - 5#

 Let x be the number of geckos that Brandon sold in the two years. We have 7 * x + 5 = 86.Then, adding the two years gives and removing 75 from 87 produces 26.Multiply the result by 3 to calculate the number of geckos that Brandon has sold in the last 3 years. 1 * (7 + 5) = 2724.Then 4 times the result gives 36 = xxxthat 42 = xxxx.Then square the number in front of x26 to find the number of cq dos jeremy sold the last 2 years.The number of geckos that Brandon has sold is 2^2 = 4.The answer is $4$.</s>#

 Let S be the number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years. Then 86 S 40 = 26SSo, there are 26 + 26* 6 = 152 geckos.Cross each term with the same number, and then transform the list into a list: 2; 4; 7; 11.Adding the 8 zeros on both sides equals 8.In the total, we subtract 26 from 52 = 8.Completing the square comes to reducing the list to 6.The answer is 8.

 Let A be the number of geckos Brandon sold last year, and let B be the geckos he sold the previous year. Therefore, A + B = 86.Let c be the geckos he sold in the two years. We can simplify 90 = AC - BC = BCIn this case, since B is 86,BC=(186 - 86)/2=45geckos.Let's refactor again!A' = A + 45.Further, B' = B + 45.Thus, A' + B' = 86 + 45 = 569.In other words, Brandon has sold 564 geckos!The answer is 564.question: In psychology class, Linda finished 20 minutes early.

 You get 86 + 86 = 216.Adding the two years produces 218As Brandon only gets sold twice a year, dividing by two produces 1 / 2 = 1/2The answer is 1/2.question: Stephen sold 57 Xbox 360 video games last year. How#

 Let x be the number of geckos sold in the last two years.Let y be the number of geckos sold by Brandon in the last year.Then the number of geckos sold by Brandon last year is x + 2*y.Now subtract the two years.However, this is a one way equation.You can add the two sides or subtract them. Thus, the expression simplifies to x = y + 2*x.But this is the same as x = 2 * (y + x).So we have x = 2 * y.And the value of y = 85.Therefore, the value of x is 2 * 85 = 165.The answer is 165.</s>#

 Let Y be the total number of geckos sold in the last two years. The previous year the total number was 86. So, the new total now is 100.Therefore, Y = 86 + 100 = 126.Then let X be the total number of geckos sold this year. We know the value of Y, so it can be added to X to calculate the value of X. The equation will now become X = 100 + Y.Therefore, X = 86 + 126 = 186.The value of Y is 46.The answer is 46 geckos.

 Let y be total number of geckos.x be (y - 1) / 2. Therefore, we have 86 / (2 * y - 1) = y / (2 * (y - 2)1) = y / (2 * (y - 5) / 2) = y / (2 * (y - 6) / 2) = y / (2 * (y - 7) / 2) =... until y / (2 * (y - 2k)1) = y / 2 = yLast year he sold k to the start of the equation.Therefore y - (2 * k + 2) / 2 - 1 = y + 2k / 2.Combining the like terms on the left side gives 2k(y - k/ 2 = y*k / 2 + 2k / 2 = y*k / 2 - 2carry + 1.Therefore, in the beginning of the second year he bought (y + 2k / 2) - 1 = y - 1 + 2k / 2 - 1 = 2k - 1.He also sold (2 * k - 1) / 2 to the start of that second year.
