 She needs 1/6 * 12 = 2 ounces.The answer is 2.question: Dave wanted to buy five canned jerky cans at a retail store. His savings account has 48 $20 bills left. If he pays with $10, $20,#

 Let S be the number of 6-ounce cups needed for the party.Then the number of 8-ounce cups she will use is 12-S.Therefore, 12 - S = 6.Letting x in the denominator allow as much room as possible in the denominator, letting 26 in the denominator allows it as much room as possible in the numerator and rearranging the equation gives 54 = 6 x 24.Transferring 1 to the denominator leaves 54 = 26.To solve for x, we have 26/24 = 1.Therefore, she will need one 6-ounce cup of tea.The answer is 1.question: Bruce crashed his motorcycle and a small part of the swingarm had broken off.

 Let p be the number of pounches made. Then 1 pounce = 6 ounces. Let m be the number of teaspoons needed to make all the 8 ounces of tea in a cup. Then 1 teaspoon = 2 ounces.Let s be the amount of tea and m be the number of teaspoons.Then 1 cup of tea = (m + s) / 2.Let r be the amount per cup. Then 1 cup of tea = (m + r) / 2.Let T be the amount of tea in the cup. Then T = s / p = 2 - 8 / 4 = 6 ounces.Therefore, Artemis needs 6 teaspoons to make all the 8 ounces of a tea in a cup and needs 2 whole cups of tea to make all the 12 people in her party. The answer is m = 3x and s = 7x=230 pounces or an amount of tea of T = 240#

 From leg 6's formula, the ratio is 8 = (12) (6).Therefore, the ratio for the party is 8/12 = 7/8 = 0.883 = 8/3 = 1.667In having 12 people, there is a total of 12 cups of tea, so 1.667 = 1 + 1.667 + 1.667 + … + 1.667 = 8 cups of tea.Therefore, Artemis needs 6 cups of tea.
