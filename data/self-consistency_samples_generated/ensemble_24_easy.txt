 There are 8 shopping trips. Multiplying the number of $10 checks by the number of $10 checks produces the number of total checks.So the total number is 40 checks; 8 times 10, totaling 80.Collected, the number is 80x40 = 320 checks.Subtracting the $10 check from the 320 checks produces the number of $30 checks.Collecting the $30 checks yields 140.The answer is 140.question: Mark appeared in 9 movies during the year.

 Let R be the credit that would have to be paid in full if Mary had only $93 this time. Then let C be the credit that she spent on the first two weeks. Then C+R = $100, and C = -45.That's the amount that Mary still has to pay. As always remember, you can work it backward.question: Emma and Charlotte are making trips to their friend to play in the yard and give them her cookies. They have two times a week for that. Susan said "When it rains, it pours." So, if it rains twice the girls will only get a trip per week. Then Jim said "when it rains, it pours hard." This time it will rain twice the hard for each#

 Let the amount she divided the credit into three equal portions. Her first portion she paid on Tuesday so her total of $15 was paid back when she bought on Thursday. Her second portion she divided the credit into two equal portions. Her first portion was paid back when she bought on Tuesday. So her second partial payment due on Thursday. And so on. Thus her credit balance and payments are cumulative. If you know how many total payments made on $10, you can figure out how much credit still needed to#

 She will need to use 35 of the $100, since she spent on Friday by Thursday.Two weeks ago Mary spent 79 so 104 - 35 = 59 left in her credit.She spent 17 + 23 + 7 = 42 on Tuesday and Thursday.She paid 6 on Tuesday and 8 on Thursday.Therefore, she must pay 47 -12 = 35. The answer is 35.article[/url]

 Let C be the credit left to purchase. Then 52 - C -15 = 23.Combining constants produces 39 - C = 23.Adding C to both sides 5C + 7 = 23C + 7 = 39.So the credit will be needed to pay.5 + 7 = 12.It takes 12 times the credit, i.e., C = 12.So C = 12 - 5 = 7.Therefore C is needed to pay.C = 7 - 15 = 8.The complete example is to have a credit limit of $90. We spend $80 on Saturday.The credit is left to purchase is C = 20. We have spent $80 + 20 = 90.The balance is B = 90 - 20 = 80. We need to pay 8.The answer is 8.QUESTIONSارةB1lets us find an online calculator that uses a trigonometric functionAnswer1 contraction has a factor of 0.5 so the area equals 0.5^2 cm^2 so the total#

 Let x be the number of dollars to be paid in full before next shopping trip.Let Y be the credit limit, i.e., the total allowed credit.Then x = Y = $100.The expression simplifies to (x + Y)/Y = 1.The value of y = (100 - 15)/24 = 1.Therefore, x = Y - 1 = 99.The answer to this question is 99.QUESTION19 — Dimwitz ancestors to John Western converted to Jewish#

 Let C be the credit Mary needs. Then M + C is her total Dolores.So, M + C = + (95 - S).Multiply the left side by 7, S by 8 produces 4649 - 59 = 67.So the credit will be 67 for her next shopping trip.The answer is 67.question: Mary visits Luke every Monday.

 Put your numbers in the equation below.That is Mary will need 107$75=47.5 dollars before her next shopping trip.So she has $C = 47.5-15$23. which gives 107 = 47.5 +23.question: What is the common denominator of 20, 20, 20, 27, 25, 32, 37, 32?

 Let C be the amount of credit that has not yet been used. Then C = 100 - 15 - 23 = $38.Combining constants produces 15 - C = $43.Adding C to both sides produces 23 + 43 = 70C = 70C is the amount of credit Mary needs. So the equation becomes 22D = 70.Then we must add D to both sides of the equation, 22(D - 1) = 70.D chose an Amen.

 Let M be the credit limit before her next shopping trip. M + (22 - 15) + (23 - 15) = 115 prior to the settlement on Tues and Thursday. Then she could spend $30 + (55 - 23) + (45 - 23) = 112, so that she would have enough to cover the credit limit.The answer is 112.Deadline: SMART tempi! | NN Czekaj!time = 1.L: Ysson's bruker deletes#

 Let B be the total amount that Mary has spent on all previous shopping trips.So, B - 15 - 23 = 27.We can apply the same formulas that we used above to make this easier. Let x be the amount that Mary has to pay to earn a credit (x + B = 100).Call the price that she pays m and the amount that she buys n.So, n - m = 60.Then, m / n = 43 / 61 =.627.And, B = n - m = (n *.627) - m = 1845 / 60 = 807.This provides a value of x = 807*.627 - 27 = 1643. Therefore, Mary needs to have the credit limit of 1643, plus the amount that she has spend so far = 1643 + 27137 = 31843.The answer is 319.question: Is there a two-digit number that is twice as large as the number one thousand six hundred twenty-six?#

 Let's start with the = sign.Since we are adding elements from sets of same size, we can cancel the first 83-81 to get: (81 = 16 + 77). Since the store only lets Mary spend $20, the remaining balance after she paid those two amounts would be (16 = 77). Next, we need a fact about order of operations. BigDecimal does arithmetic with numbers from its "magnitude" set. In this case, it will run addition and multiplication from greatest to least magnitude. Since 16 and 77 are the greatest and least numbers of the magnitude set, the rule of order of operations dictates that we first do the left side of the = sign, then if any components are removed we have removed as many numbers as possible until#

 Let c, x, and ybe the credit that the store gives Mary and the number of times she goes to the store, and the total amount spent there during that week, respectively.Let n = x + y be Mary's credit before she pays anything.Then, n = (x + y) x $ x $100.Well, x = 9 because Marcel, her father, bought 9 items and has $29 cash. Let y = 7 because Mary bought 7 items, for a total spending of $23.Then, c = n x $ DP.n = (9 x $29 + 7 x $23) x $ $100.n = (79 x $29 + 52 x $23) x $ 100.n = 79 x $65 + 52 x $27.n = 79 + 52.n = 81.Obviously, n = 81.On Monday, Mary spent the value of 9 weeks worth of items for an amount of $81.The date on which#

 Let x be the amount of credit that Mary is willing to pay for her grocery shopping. Then 100-x = 85. Adding 85 on both sides produces 100 = x + 85.Subtracting x from both sides gives 85 = 10 - x.Negative (pX = 10 -x.But if Mary's first shopping trip has a balance of $10, then (10 - x) must be negative.Therefore, her next shopping trip must have a balance of negative 90. The answer is 90.#

 There were 9 items on the first shopping trip  Thus she spent  7 * 19 = $157 on this trip. Then on the second trip there were 10 items.  So, the full credit limit and the 10% will be  9 * 19 * 0.10  or $189 and  95.90 of it, or $136.10, will be spent on this trip. Assuming Mary will spend the full credit limit and nothing more on both trips and adding the $160 she paid on Tuesday and $197 on Thursday, the total cost will be $344.89 before shopping for the next trip. So, $396.89 will be the full credit.question: Spud has an empty yam-shaped jar. It measures 20 inches#
