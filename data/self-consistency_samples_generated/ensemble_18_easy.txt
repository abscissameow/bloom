 It takes Roque 2 x 3 + 1 x 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 hours a week to walk to work and ride his bike to work.So, in total, Roque has 7 + 3 = 10 hours a week.
You need to multiply 103 by the number of days in the given month to get the total amount.

 At work 1 hour and 45 minutes of walking equals 0.45 hours per day.Thus, one day of Maria's walking at work equals 0.45 * 4 days = 1 hour and 45 minutes.One week of Maria's walking at work equals 0.45 * 7 = 1 hour and 45 minutes.One hour of bike riding is 0.25 * 1 hour = 0.25 hour.Thus Roque's time traveling at work would be 0.25 * 6 = 0.25 hours.Let T be time to get to and from work.Then TR = 1/2(0.5 * 5 + 0.25 *2) = 0.5 * 6 + 0.25 = 4.So TR = 4 and the answer is 4. question : The biography about ZZ Top contains the following information: "Taking an advantage of double-lined-leading, the five co-singers played back-sequenced, contrasting solos over thick treble octaves which were LeP#

 For the walking from work to home, let T be the time it takes Roque to walk from work to home. Use this value to solve for the hourly walking speed, V. Therefore, T = V x 1 x 3. Let S be the time it takes Roque to indicate the speed to the traffic police. Let X be the time it takes for the traffic police to catch Roque grabbing a juice from the fridge. Then 1 x 2 x X.Therefore, S = V x T x 3 = V x (T + X) x 3 = V x 16 x 3 = V x 300 = 250.So there is one hour per day.Time to eat, change clothes and commute home = 2 hours per day.#

 A complete day at work would be 9.5 hours either with walking or biking.Thus, at work on a typical day, Roque walks 9.5 / 3 = 27 hours during the first week and rides 27 hours during the second week to get to and from work.Thus, Roque walks to work 2 * 4 * 7 hours and rides to work 4 * 2 * 5 hours.The answer is 9.5 * 2 + 7.5 * 2 = 69.5 * 2 =#

 Since it took Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to bike, he walked to work two times, and biked twice with two hours a week.So, if he walked to work one hour then he walked four hours (because he walked in an hour from home to work, and then walked a minute or less from work to go home.).

 Let T be the total time that Roque takes.Then the total time that Roque takes walking and biking is T = s + 2T where T is the time that Roque takes with the car and s is the sum of all the times that Roque takes walking and biking.Because Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, s = 3, and therefore T = 3 + 2 = 5.Then, because Roque bike to and from work 2 times a week, all he needs to do is remove 1 to both sides and distribute 1 to the square, which leaves 5 - 2 = 3. Then T = 5 - 2 = 3 hours + 1 hour = 6 hours. Therefore, Roque's total time to and from work is 6#

 The total distance traveled is 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours with both walking and biking. The distance from work to the bus stop is 3 * 3 * 3/60 = 300m. The distance from the bus stop to off is 300/60/30 = 53.5 meters. Roque traveled 53.5 meters on foot and 300m on his bike during the second trip. The answer is 53.5.question: Now let us calculate the total amount of work done by the two workers.#

 Let w be the number of hours that Roque walks to work.Let's say w = 3.Then w = 3 * 5.25 = 15.Combining the like terms, w + 3 = 3 * 5 + 5 + 5 = 20.Then, 5 = w = 2.Carla gets to work in 5 hours and 15 minutes, adding another 5 minutes to that by using the bike.That leaves Roque in 10 hours and 25 minutes to get to work.Therefore, the number of hours in a week that Roque takes to get to and from work with walking is 10.And the number of hours in a week that Roque takes to get to and from work with using the bike is: 2 * 10 = 20 hours + 2 = 22#

 Let k the number of days that Robot works.Let x be the number of hours he walks to work with adding the number of hours on the train to get to work from his home.Then 2x = k + 3k.And 3x = x + 2x2 + k2x.Equating with k = 2x gives k = 2x / 3. And solving for x gives which is equal to where the number of hours that Roque spends walking to work is equal to the number of hours he spends commuting on the train without walking.The answer is, where recall traffic is 2.question: Every Monday, Rembrandt painted one of his best paintings.

 Let W be the number of weeks that Roque walked to and from work.Then 2 + W = 4 weeks.Summing up W + 3 * W = 6 wholegroup assignment2 hours in the first week + 1 hour in the second week + 1 hour in the third week = 3.5 hours in the first week + 3.5 hours = 10.5 hours = 1.5 day.In addition the first two weeks if he rode his bike to and from work he would have been able to walk back to work a second week.

 So, Roque walks to work twice a week for 3 x 30 minutes = 90 minutes each time.Riding his bike to and from work twice a week for 2 x 30 minutes = 90 minutes each time.Therefore, Roque takes 2 * 90 + 3 * 90 + 2 * 90 = 270 minutes to get from work twice with walking and biking a week.The answer is 270.question: 11 students are at the skating rink at the same time.
