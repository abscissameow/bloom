 Let t be years of James teaching plus the years of his partner teaching.Then, t = 30 + 10 = 40.Then 3t -8 = 30, or: 3t = 80.So 10t = 60.  The answer is 80.#

 Let x be the number of years that James has worked.  Let y be the years of each partner. So, 10 + 0 = 10. 10 x 0 = 10. 10 x 1 = 10 years. 10 x 5 = 50 years.  Therefore, the combined experience is 10 x 5 +10 x = 75 years. The answer is 40 years.question: John wanted to buy a bottle of water with a can. The price was 3 books. He bought 3 books and the can of water#

 Let T be the number of years each teacher has been teaching together.The total is T - t1+t2+...+t10=49 + 9 + 6 +... + 152 = 651.The minimum answer is C = 651 + 49 = 669The maximum answer is C = 651 - 9 = 660The answer is 660 years.question: In a 15-game football season, a team can win 5 games and finish in the top 2. They can win 8 games and finish in the top#

 We can build an equation to solve for a.Using each years produced would give us (45*10)/(40*10) = 15/4 = 3 seasons.If we take one 10 for the first term we have 40*1/3 = 8.Now take the back product like this.0 is 10 times two.10 is 10 times three.12 - 4 = 8.Taking the proposition backproduct produces 8x4 = 32.The answer is 8 + 32.question: Henry is#

 If somebody teaches for 10 years, the partner will be teaching for 20. This just adds in an extra 0 for each extra year of experience. Otherwise, if a person has started teaching a year earlier than his partner, the first person will have been teaching for 10 years, whereas the second will have been teaching for 20 years. Then Jerry's experience is 10 + 20 = 30 years. Then their combined experience is 30 years.Answer: Since James has been teaching for 40 years and his partner has been teaching for 10 years, their combined experience is 40 + 10 = 50 years.  They were married for 20 years, which is 10 years less than James' experience, so the total number of years their experience was together is the number of years both#

 Let the combined experience = X + Y.So X = 10 and Y = 40.Then X + Y = 50.Combine the similar terms we have X + (40 - (10 - Y)) = 50.Since X - Y is 10, the equation simplifies to 10 - 45 = 15.Then 10 - 15 = 5.Subtract X from each side, so (5 + 10) - 5 = 45.The solution is 45 years.question: Steve saved $7.25 by buying a wine bottle at the store and the leftover wine is poured into a bottle opener.  Then he put the bottle opener back in the spice drawer.  How much did he save overall?  What was the original price of the bottle opener#

 Because his years of experience is 40 - 10 = 20 years, multiplication produces 20 x 1 = 20 years.Therefore, their combined experience is (40 + 20) x 1 = 40 years.Since we know James will teach for 40 years, the number 10 is divide by 40 because if it was 80 years, it would be 10 divided by 80, so 10 divided 40 = 20%.so the answer would be 20%.question: Frank ran 9.8 miles per hour on his way to school#

 Let a be the total teaching years of James and b be the total teaching years of his friend.  Then a + b = 40.  Subtract 10 from both sides to produce a - (10 + b) = 30.  Since 30 is less than 40 we have a - (10 + b) ≥ 0.  As a consequence we have b ≥ 10.  The answer is b = 10.question: One third of a box is $3.25 each.  How much is the total cost of a#

 Let t be the years now that James has to think of his achievements.  Let t be the years their combined experience.  Thus, t = 10 years + (t - 10) = 10 years + 40 (t)Equality here should produce 60 - 40 = 20 years = the years of experience now that they have taken.The solution is t = 60 - 40 = 20 years of experience.The answer is 20 years of experience.question: A copy machine uses 25 sheets at a time. #

 Let x be the number of years that James teaches.Then the number of years the partner has been teaching would be (2 (x + 1)) x (2 (x + 1)) = 104 ( 2 * 104 * x + 1)Let y be the number of years the partner has been teaching.Then the number that James has taught would be (2 (104 + 1)) x (2 (104 + 1)) = 104 ((2 (106 + 1)) * x + 1)Let Z = 5.To subtract Z from both sides of the equation, we need to add the value of Z = 5 times the difference. The term multiplied by 298 to the left side of the equation becomes (2 (106+1)) x {#

 Assume that the partners' combined experience is the same in both 10 year intervals.Then, subtract the number of years in the second 10 year interval from the number of years in the first 10 year interval so they both have 10 years of experience $1/40 = 10/10$.Thus, they have 40 years of combined experience. The answer is 40 years.question: Andy had $7,000 on Thursday.  He wants to save his money over the following 6 days.  On the first days that he#

 Let x be the combined experience of James and his partner in years.  James and his partner have 40 - x years of combined experience since they started each other’s teaching.  Since they started teaching, the equation simplifies to x + (40 - x) = (10 - x) years.  Thus, x = 10 years and their combined experience = 40 - (10 - x) = 20 years. The answer is 20 years question:matt stays at the golf club every Thursday after work.  He#

 Let s be the number of years that James has been a teacher.Then let t be the number of years that his partner has been a teacher.Then let (s + t) = t - s = 2.Then t -s = 1.The answer is 4 years.question: In the hours passed Saturday, four people received three pieces of mail. How many pieces of mail did Sally receive?answer: Let x be the number of pieces of mail received.Then Sally received x + 4x#

 Let x be the number of years of experience that the two spent together.  Let A be the number of years of experience that James spent without his partner.Then we have x + A = 40 years of experience.And then, we have x + A = 10A - x = 10A thus A = 10x - x So we have A = 10 * (40 - 10) = 100 - 10 = 90 years of experience in total.Thus the man has 100 minus 10 = 90 years of experience and the woman has 90 years of experience.Let A be the number of years of experience that the man had before the woman joined the company.  Then x + A = 40 years of experience in total.  The woman had 10A - x#

 Let A be the number of years James taught.  Let B be the number of years his partner has taught.  Then A + B = 40.So A = 10 + B = 30.Let V be the combined experience of the two teachers which is 10 + 30 = 40 years. Then to find their combined experience when they were at their peak, divide the number of years they had experienced by the number they would have experienced had they not worked together and you would get 9/10ths plus 1/2 tenth for A + B = 26.This is the rate of experience that he would have achieved alone for every hour that he worked with James.If you ignored the time he worked with James, then the total amount of experience that he would have acquired over#
