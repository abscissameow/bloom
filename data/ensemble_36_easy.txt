 The total amount earned is $60.Since Lisa got 50/60 of the team's money, some other brothers got the other 50/60.  Let x be the number of brothers who received money.  Then we have: x * 59 = $59.5. x * 40 = $40.5So we have: 59 + 40.5 = $59.5.Let B be the money the Brian brothers received.  Then we have: B = 60 - 59 - 40.5 = 15A goole search for 25 - 50/60 $brothers receives money should produce the equation.Note that there are x = 5B = 15+FirstOrDefault incorrect answers are due to a typo(?)in the constant.Keep in mind means to equal.Question 1#

 Let Lisa be the number of cars she washed for Paul alone. Then 79 - 52 - 26 = 12.If we ignore the 26 cars, the remaining cars are (52 / 2) + 26 = 78.Thus, the total number of caries that Tommy washed was 78.The value of x is 78 / 52 = 1.Therefore, Paul paid Lisa $1 as a tip.The answer is $1.question: Ashley lost 3 percentage points after participating in the assembly. It was 4 percentage#

 Let t be the amount of money that Tommy earned.Let l be the amount of money that Lisa earned.Then we have 60 - t - l = 30 because they earned the same amount of money.They also drove the same amount of miles to wash the cars, so obviously they spent the same amount of time.Then the percentage of their work should beSimilar to the definition of percentage above -> I have three group.Each group should have the same quantity.Then we increase the first group by some value then add the value to the second group, and then subtract the first group's quantity from the second group's sum.I have an example to help understand it -> [ 1a-b -b + a ] / 2How I wrote itonline example#

 Let X be the total cash paid by Tommy.Let Y be the total cash paid by Lisa.Then X + Y = $60.  There was some cash paid by both husbands, so let K be the total amount paid by the two.K = 55 Then Kiki earned X = (K - 1/2)/2 = 40/50 - (75/50) = 15.Then Kiki earned Y = 1/2*40 - 1/2*15 = 10$. So the total was (X + Y) = 15 + 10 = 25.Therefore, more than half of the money earned by Lisa was 25 dollars.The answer is 25.question: Eileen has three adult sons and one adult daughter.

 Let A be the amount earned by Jack.  Let B be the amount earned by Lisa.  Let C be the amount of money earned by Tommy. Since Kelly earned the rest of the two's, then we have A = 80 + (60 - 50 = 10) and  B = 40 + (60 - 50 = 10).So we have A = 80 + 10 = 90 and B = 40 + 10 = 50. So the amount she earned is 50 - 50 = 10.So she earned 10 more than Tommy earned.The answer is 10 more.question: Maggie made $50 from selling four jerseys. Five people bought two jerseys each.

 Let l be the money earned by Lisa. Let m be the money that Tommy earned.Then let x be the number of days during which Tommy earned more money than Lisa.Then let y be the number of days during which Lisa earned more money than Tommy. Which of those numbers x and y should be used to calculate how much more money lisa earned than m?Answering this question requires working with the raw data in the form a² + bx + c or a² + bx + c = 0. Since y² + ly + l = 0, the possible solutions to this equation are negative infinity or y or -ly such that y + l = 0. Since all of the data points are positive, the only positive solution#

 Let A be the number of hours that Lisa worked. Let B be the number of hours that Tommy worked. Then, A x B = A + B. Let D be difference between Laura and Tommy.Then D = A - B.Let V be the number of cars washed. Then, V = A x B. Because D = V - A x B. Then V = A x B + (A - B).Therefore, D = VA - A x B x (1 - 1/50) = V(A - B) - A x B x 1 - 1/50 = 6x(A - B) - ((A - B)x50 - 55).  Equation vs Figure equation, also known as the dot-product or cross-product rule, is a test used on engineering testing for vector capability.

 Let A be the money earned by Karen.Leting S be the ratio, we have S = X/A where X is the money given to Karen.So Lisa earned A x (1 - S) = A*(1 - (0.4)) = A*0.6 = $36.The number of Tommy's dollars earned was A x (1-0.6) = 0.4*60 = $9.Thus, you have $30 + 9 = $39 from the answer.#

 Let x be the number of car wash earns wich was done by Lisa.So, x = 54 (59 paid to Barey and 1 paid to Tommy).there are 19 car wash earns so ((59 - 1 + 54)/19) = x.And ((59 - 1 - 54)/x) = 55.So, the total car wash earnings were 56.25.So, Tomie earned (((55 - 1)x) ÷ 55) = (55 - 1) x = x dollars.Therefore, Lisa earned more.The answer is 25.question: Keith has 7 bikes and 11 cars.

 Let the total reward be 10.Let the reward that Jack received be 8, let the reward that Jack got minus the reward that he gave be 2.Let the reward that Tommy received minus the reward he gave be 4.Then, let the total reward minus the 110 they gave be 4.Thus, the total reward is 10 - 8 - 2 - 4 = 2.Now, let's start from the lower estimate. Let Lisa's reward be the average of the 120 that she earned.Thus, the price that she got is $10 - 8 = 2 = $2.So she earned $80.Then, let Tommy's reward be the average of the 110 that he earned.Thus, 5 = $10 - 8 = 2.So he earned $50#

 Let A be the money earned by Lisa and let T be the money earned by Tommy. Then 6 * 60 = 360.Adding A and T, we have 6 + 360 = 378.And dividing the sum by 2, 6/378 = 1.75 times as much as T.Thus, Lisa earned 1.75 times as much as Tommy.The answer is 1.75.question: Vince gave Vincent $25. Vince gave the same amount to his wife, and her friends, and#

 Let B be the amount earned by Lisa, such that B = $36.Then 12 - B = 40.To the benefit of her family, Jack and Tommy could each receive the same amount. Therefore, the amount given to them would be (12 - B) / 2 = 16/10 = $16.The answer is $16.question: The mother of a girl bought her a new handbag for $20.

 Let M be the total money earned.Then 3/4 + 1/4 = 3 / 4.So, if we transfer 1 counter from the weeks of Tommy to the weeks of Lisa then 3 / 4 * 1/2 = 11 / 4.Thus, Throw 1 counter from the weeks of Tommy  to the weeks of Lisa.The weeks of Lisa will be 3 / 4  * 1 =  11 / 4 times.The amount of money earned by Lisa on those weeks is: 11 / 4 * 55 / 100 = 331 / 100 or 3. 31/100 original</s>Introduction

 Let A be the number of cars that Lisa earned $60.Equation A·2 + B – A·B = 60 is equivalent to A = 60/2 + B - 60/2 = 35.From this equation it is evident thatEach person wanted to work for a different amount of money.Thus, we have to substract the negative value from both sides which just reduces the NBCHA(Negative Booked Charge and Handled Adjustment ) to NBC(Negative Booking Credit).Therefore, the total minus B = 60 / 2 - ( get booked and handle + wages charged ) =??need 45. Therefore, A = 45. This means that 15 of the cars were cash earned ( because the car was assigned to someone that#

 Let x be the $60 that was earned by all three boys.Then, the income earned by Lisa is x/2 + x/2 = x.The income earned by Jack is x/2 - x/2 = 1/2 * 60.The income earned by Tommy is 1/2 * 60 - x/2 = - x/2 = 18.The income earned by all three boys is therefore 18.The answer is 18.where all the B's are positive.question: Dave eats candy to keep himself stimulated#
