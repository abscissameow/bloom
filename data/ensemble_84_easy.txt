 Let N be the total number of rooms that Hans might check into.So, there would be 10 number of rooms given that the last floor is unavailable.Thus, there would be 10 number of rooms on the first, second,..., 10th floor.Thus, the expression requires to factor 10 with 1.question:  There are 11 days between Christmas and President's Day.  On day 5, there are no school days.  On day 3, there is a holiday day, and on any day, there is only one exam day.  There are at most four exams on any day. How many Mondays will there be?answer: The days between Christmas and President's Day is 52.  There are only 36 days fully school days.  There are 36#

 There are 6 rooms on the first floor.6 rooms covers all of the 5 floor which means each floor has 6 rooms, and there are only 10 floors so 10x6 = 60 rooms. Therefore, there are 60 rooms to be used.More than one guest could be checked in on each floor, but there is only 1 room on the 11th floor. The solution to the problem is 60.question: Katie is a 4 years elder to Jack. She collects 1000 dollars in one year. She split the money equally between having a thousand dollar bank account and renting 1 apartment. How many apartments would count if Jack had no bank account?answer: Let K be the number of apartments, then 1000 divides K cochrane's rule is 0#

 Let X be the number of rooms that two or more guests could be checked in into.Then the number of rooms that Hans is able to get into is X = 10 * (10 * (X - k)) / (10 - k + 1) = 10.2.179312 Thus X = 10 or k is 0.The answer is 0.question: Ana and Jennifer were playing safe jump rope for 15 minutes. During that time Ana wonencies 5 times andJennifer-5 times.#

 The hotel has 10 floors so it has 10 rooms per floor. Therefore, if Hans was checked on the first floor, he could remain on the first floor. If he was checked on the second floor, he could remain on the second floor. If he was checked on the third floor, he would have to walk down three floors, getting ready to check in at the same hotel. Therefore, there are 10! = 3! = 6 ways to be checked in.The answer is 6.question#

 Hans was booked in the limit of a line of 100 identical rooms : the floor on the left of the door was forbidden, so there were exactly only 10 left.The positive coefficients and weird expressions can fudge it up, but can't you solve those on your own? The book did get you up to here though, so I guess then you should figure it out yourself. See my answer to your problem in UGC Q1 above. If you haven't figured it out yet, don't worry about it.#

 At breakfast, Hans sits in his spare room at the bottom of the hotel next to the lift. No one else is awakened by this. No other guests occupy the remaining 9 rooms.
Hans' room is 10:10.Thus there are 10 hotel rooms: (3:9), (1:10), (1:7), (1:3), (6:7), (1:6), (1:8), (2:10), (1:9), (1:4), (15:10).The 10 hotels are one block long. So there are 10 floors or 10 blocks, since there are 1000 rooms in 1 block.Therefore, Hans could be checked in up to 10 blocks from his bed or he could be checked back in at the bottom of the hotel; that is, 10:10.or he could be#

The hotel has 10 identical rooms in 10 floors with only 1 available on the last floor. So this means that we have dozens of possible room assignments for Hans. Considering there are no other guests, and only 1 available, the number of possible guest assignments is less than 100. The number is less than 99. The number is less than 98, and so on. And the number is less than 10. Thus, the number of possible room assignments for Hans is less than 10.The answer is 10.question: Two new cars were announced for sale yesterday. One was $100 more expensive and the other less expensive. What was the third new car’s price?answer: They may have someone who is a collector and who is aware of the prices#

 Let f be the number of different rooms that Hans could be turned into.Then the number of rooms that are available (not on any of the ten floors) is 10 - f.And the number of floors is 10 - 10 - = 0. Therefore, there will always be 10 different rooms for Hans to check in to.In other words, there will always be exactly 10 different rooms for Hans to check in to.The answer is 0.question: There are 10 ducks and 8 chick#

 Hans can check in in at all 10 floors. There are 10 different ways to divide each floor into uniform slots. There are 10 oscillations, in each of which there are 10 different choices.Falta un espacio vertical. There would be 10 oscillations.Cada persona necesitaría 10 habitaciones horizontales. It would be 10 people.The answer is 10.question: Four apples were dropped into the sink.  A is the number of apples that were dropped onto the floor, B is the number of apples that flo#

 let A be the floor that is available, K be the number of guests, S be the number of guests who are on the floor A, and F be the floor that is unavailable.Let k equal the number of guests who are on plate A.Then i is the number of different floors that could be the place where the came in.F is different floors than A and from the the formula, i can be calculated easily by 3k - 4.But:K is 10 and i is the number of different floors that could be the place where k can be any number from 10 to 1 i.e. i can take Minimum 10 partitions and maximum 10 partitions are possible.So, i represents the number of partitions in its maximum i.#

 Let x be the number of rooms that Hans is checking in.Let y be the number of different floors.Thus, there are 10! floor combinations = x! which can be expressed in lower case form as 2x! = 10! so x! y! = 1.And because there are no other guests, Hans only needs to check in rooms in those 10!y! = 10!different fles.Given that x is comprised of those x! unique ways.So the equation is 10!y! = x! and can simplify to 10!y! = y! so that becomes 10! = y! = 1.Therefore, x! = 1 which means there is only one floor that Hans can be checked in on.The#

 First, observe that the following is true: Helen could stay if Pierre stays - and Pierre could stay if Francis stays, - and Francis could stay if Helen stays, - and Helen and he could stay, if Francis and Pierre stay, - and in any of these lets say Francis or Pierre had stayed, Helen i would have stayed too.Note that we could get anywhere by paying all the hands out. All of these are different parts of the same question or the same answer.So, consider these#

 Therefore, H is the total number of rooms, so when the hotel is full, there would be 100 rooms. 180 / 10 - 85 = 95 rooms. Therefore, Hans could be checked in in 95 different rooms and could be checked out in 180 - 95 = 35 different rooms. The answer is 35.</s>#

 Let R be the room number of the available room. Then the numbers of available room is R + 1... R + 9 = 10.Then R + 8 = 7.And then R + 7 = 6.Thus R = 6.Accordingly, unlike any other floors, the last floor is available for them.So in how many different possible rooms could they be checked in?The answer is 6 * 10 = 60.The minimum number of different rooms is 60 / 10 = 5.Therefore,#
