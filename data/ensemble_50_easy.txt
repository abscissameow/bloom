 Their goal is to save enough dollars to pay for the supplies for 4 months in a season.So, increase $ 100 by /3.If he paves 1/2 a season, he would have /4 months to rake,shovell, and mow after the season was over. So, he could save 1/6th of a month.If he cleans the house every 2 weeks and mows every 4, he could save 1/8th of a month.Making every 8 chores remarkable, we can divide the price by 8.So, $2.5 per chore to average monthly chores.The answer is $1.25 per month.question: Hedy Lamarr chartered a luxury yacht for a trip from Turkey to Greece.#

 Let x be the number of chores he needs at least to make $95 in month t, or for that t to be his budget.Then we want (x + 1) to be within 17 chores of he budget, or 83.5 chores.Since we have to save money, we want x to be less than the $95 that's needed to save up for the season of baseball. Then we want 83.5 - (x + 1) = 84.5.But the e quotes are believed to have a negative value. So we want the opposite: 84.5 + (x + 1) = 85.5.Thus 84.5 - quality/10 = x.From scratch, we have 84.5 - quality/10 = x. Then, let x = 1.With quality = $100, the answer is x =...= 1.Therefore, the answer is 1 chore.question: If Sarah and Steve each spent $17 on tickets for a baseball#

 He needs to rake, and mow for 4 months (87 chores in total) to average $10 per month to cover disposable expenses. First, distribute 87 evenly 4 times, that results in 37 chores a month. But then, he has 1 noticeable month with all 4 chores, so his average for that month is 4 / (4 + 1) = 6.Then, repeat this process until he gets 1 noticeable month with only one chore. After that, his cost per chore is 4 + 4 / 6 = 8.But he still needs 90 chores to average $10 per month. Their answer is 4 + (4 + 6) / (18 + 6) = 8.The answer is 8.#

 Let N be the number of chores that Gerald needs to do a given month to save up for his supplies. Then 3/4 * N = N * 3/4 = 45 chores.Let x be the number of months that Gerald didn't play baseball. Then the equation reduces to 45/60 * x + 45/60 = x.If Gerald had been playing baseball for all 6 months, then x = 3 and the total number of chores that he needs to do a month would be 45/3*60 = 12 chores, less than the aims asked. Thus, if Gerald didn't play baseball for one or more months, then some other months he had to play baseball for more to save up for what he needs.The answer is 12.the answer -#

 Let x be the number of chores that Gerald needs to do a month. Since Gerald plays 4 months out of a season, we know he'd play for 40 months in non-season months, so 40 - 20 = 20.Then 6x is the value of x.And 20x is the value of the number of chores.We can see that the left hand side of the equation: 6x = 20x has 6 constant terms.We distribute 6 = 6 constant terms on the left side to x terms on the right.  Since the first term on the right is 18x and the second term is 18x - 1, Sehingga 6x = -(18*x) + (18 * (x - 1)), maka 3x + (#

 A month has 26.5 hours so just given his average chore time of 8 hours a day, he would have to do 3.75 chores per hour = 1.3 jobs/day to keep up with his little league ball game.  If he spends that $1.3 of extra time on lawn chores, each job will cost him 38 cent, or at least he shouldn't charge less than 38 cents for each job.  So his real "price per shot/cycle" (whatever) would be 41, or 41*15= you're right about that answer. But the "price per shot/cycle" can vary since if it is a short season, say 18 times a season, each job will cost them 31.25 cents#

 Let x be the average amount of time that he spends chasing after/keeping up with his chores over the course of a month.And let x be the average amount of time that he spends raking, shoveling, and mowing during a month.Then the expression simplifies to 9x + 4x - 12 = 0.And the value of x equals to the number of times (over the course of 4 months) that he spends between $2 and $25 on chores, if he is using 10 minutes of his time for every chore.Additionally, he spends average 1 hour a day on chores that he uses to save up his money. So his total time is 4 x 1 + 1#

 Let x be the number of chores that Gerald did each month. Then the total x would be 4 x x = 80.Let S be the cost of a chore. Then S * x = 100.king = S * x + 100 = 100 + 80 = 120Thus, the number of chores Gerald did per month is x = 1 + 80/60 + 80/40 + 80/20 = 15;The answer is 15.think about this loạt be longer answers:Q:Rain.

 Let x be the number of chores done in a month.Then the number of chores Gerald needs to do throughout the season is 3 * x.The number of months he spends playing baseball is 4. Thus, the expression simplifies to 3/4 * x = x.To solve for x, we have x = 3/4 * 12 = 6.Therefore, he needs to do 6 chores per month.The answer is 6.question: Sandy owns $500 worth of silver jewelry.#

 Gerald rakes the lawn, digs the soil, and mows the grass monthly for $120 bonus.Let x be the average number of chores he does a month for his supplies.So, 4 months - x = 1.Then 4 months - √2 = 1.Then 4 months - √2 + 1 = 2.Combining like terms gives 2 = x2 – x.Then 2 * (-15) = 65 - 15 = 60.Furthermore, the second term can be rewritten as 15 * 10 = 150, where 5 is the amount he saves a month using his bonus. Therefore, x = 60.The answer is 60.question: A farmer subtracted a 4 from 7 nurses and added a 2 to 2 pilots#

 Spending $100 on baseball supplies allows Gerald to make $200 in the four months he plays baseball.What is the average amount that he makes when he pays nobody?Let n be the number of months he rakes, shovels, and mows. Then n * 105 + 100 = $200.However, he spends n * 10 + 10 $50Is there a way to solve this equation? Putting both sides on the same side of the equation produces: 210 = n * 10 + 10.To solve 210 / 10 = n, then, we have.n = 210/10 = 30.Therefore, he averages 30 $10's per month.The answer is 30.Question: There are 9 apples left out of 100 and there#
