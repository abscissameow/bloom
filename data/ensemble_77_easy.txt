 Let q be the weight.r = 3 q = 3(97 kg) = 96 kg.The next time the boxer weighs 97 kg, he will have lost a total of 3 kg. So q = 96 kg + 3 kg = 100 kg.The answer is 100 kg.

 How many days will he weigh 48 pounds after losing 2 pounds per day?Now, he adds 2 pounds to the previous weight.So 48 - 2 = 48Other things being equal, he will weigh 48 on the day of the fight.The answer is 48.This is a better description of this problemWe know that he was n days away from the fighting weight we elided the precise numbers to make things easier for you.So we would weight the boxer 48 on day n and 48 +#

 Let x be the weight of the boxer on the day of the fight.Then let t be the time since the fight.Let s be the rate at which the weight is lost (in kilograms per month).Then, weight = total weight - e s (total weight - 97) = total weight - 3 * e s(total weight - 97) = net weight - 3 * e s(total weight - 97)This is the equivalent form of y = 3 * e s t where y is the weight on the day of the fight.Maximize the function, which is to find the value s and then solve for x and t.Thus the greatest weight x is equal to the weight at time t.This is because s#

 Let x be the number of kilograms of muscle that he has lost from 4 to 5 before the fight.Then 92 - 13 - x / 12 = 22, which is 4 kg less than the weight of an Olympic half marathoner.So his minimum weight on the day of the fight must be 22.The answer is 22. question : If Quitte wins every draw and wins from sub + 0, then the number of games to beat sub is five. If avoid wins every draw,#

 Let S be the amount of weight that he should lose in one month. We have 97 - 3 + 3x3 = -4.We multiply this by 30/36 = 0.894 so that we can add this to his current weight to get how much weight he should lose over three months. Then he should lose 97 - 4 + 3 × 0.894 = -30. Then he should reduce his weight by 3 × 0.894 = 12 kg per month. Therefore, he should lose 3 x 12 = 24 kg over three months.The answer is 24 kg.question: Lollipop spent $1.50 on yogurt at a store. She brought home 4 yogurt bars and took 12 of the yogurt bars back to the store. She#

 Let C be the number of kilograms he will weigh on the day of the fight. Then C = 97 - 3 * 365 = 48.Given that the weight will be decreased by 3kg per month until the day of the fight, the first day he weighed 97 he weight would be 37.Therefore, the next day he will weigh 61 kg.The answer is 61.</s>#

 Let w be the weight of the boxer on the day of the fight. Then x = 97 + 3y (3 weeks) = 97 + 3 × 4 (months) + 3 = 9.46 so y = 1. The relationship between a and y is a = x−y = 9.46−4 = 5.46 months.That is, the cube root of 97 ÷ 5.46 = 6,804.Thus, the weight of the boxer on the day of the fight is 97 ÷ 6,804 ≈ 67 kg.The answer is 75.In order to lose 3.5 kg, he had to weigh 68.054 kg before the fight.The answer is 67.question: a ____ on an examination#

 If 97 kg - 3 kg = 86 kg, then 4 months + 86/3 = 108 kg.Therefore, the weight of the boxer on the day of the fight is 100 kg.The answer is 100.# Source: A lot of the math#

 Let B be the weight of Joe before the fight. The weight of Joe on the day of the fight will be B x (4 - 3)/2 = 23.122kg.Because the boxer kept losing weight each month, his weight must have been smaller than 23.122kg.Thus, the answer is smaller than 23.122kg. The answer is smaller than 4.5kg.  Some of the answer may be closer to 4kg or 4.3kg  The answer is#

 Let B be the total weight loss from the start to the fight.Balance the third equation, so it becomes 3/4 x 3 = 3/4 x2 - 1/4.Then add constants to simplify it to 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/2 (1-1/x).Then take the derivative to find a x and obtain a = 1/2.Thus the weight loss rate before the fight is 1/2.The answer is 1/2.question: Elliot and Bianca went bowling for 6 holes. Elliot rolled 14 times. Bianca rolled 4 times more#

 Let x be the weight before and y be the weight on the day of the fight. Then x = 97 and on the day of the fight x = x - 3 = 96.Expressing these numbers in terms of variable k, we get 70k + 3 = 96k.This is known as a polynomial equation and can be solved by taking the difference of the denominators and multiplying by the factor k.Therefore, since 97 - 96 = 1, k = 1. Since 69 - 66 = 3, k = 3.Dividing both sides by 71 we get s = 79/71 = 0.866.The answer is 0.866.question: A girl paid for an X factor (3000 inflamation milliliters of#

 Whichever number is smaller to that the triple product gives the formula above.= ((97 * 3)) / 4This becomes 97 *. (1 / (3 / 4) = 6 / 23.So we need to find 6 times 23.We have: 6 * 23 = 154.but 8 times C5 - C23 = 144.So we need to find 8 times 11 using the previous formula.= ((7 * 8) - 7 * 11) / (8 - 1)This becomes ((7 * 8) - 7 * 11) / (8 - 1) = 152 / 22.So we need to find 20 times 11.So we have = ((200 * 8) - 200 * 11) / (8 - 1)This becomes ((200 - 2) * 8) / (8 - 1) = 168 / 8.So we need to find 20 times positive 168.This is = (((2168) - 2) * 8) / (8 - 1) =#

 We have 97 - a - 3 = 94 kg at the beginningTo lose 3 kg per month, the boxer would have to weight 54 kg at the end of a 12-month period. Hence, his weight would end up at 94 + 54 = 164 kg.Thus, the weight will be 164 at the day of the fight.

 We have the equation 49 - (3 * 4/9) = 14769 which is the weight of the boxer on the day of the fight.The boxer was 97 kilos when he started, so on the day of the fight, he would weigh 98kilos.Let x be the weight he weighed on the day of the fight (we have 4/9 since he lost 3 kg per month).The boxer weighed x + 3 * 4/9 = 117/kg on the day of the fight.We know that he weighed more than he weighs now because we hadn't forced the value of x, so, we subtract 3 kg from x to get the total weight of the boxer when he started at 97 kg.Solving the new expression#
