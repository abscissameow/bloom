 number of birds eaten number of birds eaten x number of snakes eaten (3 * 5) - 12 = number of beetles eatenIt can be simplified as ((12 + 5) - 12) / 6 = number of beetles eatenIt can be simplified as ((12 + 5) - 12) sixth, (12 + 5) fifth = number of beetles eatenIt can be simplified as ((12 + 5) sixth - (12 fifth)/6 = number of beetles eatenIt can be simplified as ((12 + 5) (6 variations removed) / 5 - 12 sixth)/6= number of beetles eatenThere will be 3 birds eaten in addition to the 5/second given to the snake. If there are 6 snakes total,#

 There are 6 birds and one jaguar.Thus, the number of birds eaten is 6 x 12 = 96 each day. Then the number of beetles eaten by the jaguar is 9 - 6 = 3 each day. Therefore, the number of beetles eaten each day is (6 x 12) - (3 - 1) = 48.The answer is 48.question: Some eggs are fed to birds for a week, and then some are taken away and fed to fish. After a#

 Let P be the number of beetles eaten on a given day by the P birds.Then 525 = P * 3 * 5On a daily basis, they must eat 3 birds per day, 5 snakes per day, and 12 beetles per day. But, if there are 6 birds and 6 snakes in the forest, the birds must eat 12 * 6 = 96 beetles each day.  On the other hand, the snakes must eat 3 * 6 = 18 beetles each day.Multiplying the equation by 3 and 5, respectively, on the left hand side produces 6 * 96 + 18 * 3 = 525.And doing the same on the right hand side 22 * 6 gives 6 * 895 plus 18 * 5 gives 525#

 Let X be the number of beetles eaten.Then 1 + 3*X + 3*X = 6.x = X + 6..Since X has to be an integer so, X cannot be divisible by 3, therefore X can equal 1 or 2 or 4 or 6.Therefore, there are 6 beetles eaten each day which is 6/60 = 12 beetles per day.The answer is 12.question: There are 4 idiots in the city that get up at 3am to buy lot#

 It seems that, for each bird, there are 5 snakes, where each snake eats 3 birds and each bird eats 3 snakes.Let m be the number of birds, n be the number of snakes and X be the number of beetles eaten per day.Then X = m n-3.Therefore 37.125 beets are eaten per day.The first two solutions would represent this a single jaguar and a single bird eating their 6 beetles per day. The third and final solution would represent 2 jaguars and 2 birds in the forest.  The answer is 37.125 beets per day.question: In a hospital there are 107 rooms available for patients. Let p be room available for patients per night#

 Let X be the number of birds eaten.Let Y be the number of reptiles eaten.Let Z be the number of under-mouthed creatures eaten.Then 6X = Y + Z. Width="100%"(6X - Y + Z)/6 = X divided by3 times 5 plus (Y divided by 3 times 5) plus (Z divided by 3 times 5).Therefore, X = 3 times 5 + (Y divided by 3 times 5) + (Z divided by 3 times 5).The answer is 48.answer: Now, the more our wife marries other guys, the more our wife likes little trashy stuff in the house.  More wife = more cheap furniture = messy stuff.Elliot has three hens. #

 Let A be the number of beetles eaten by birds. Then 12 - A - 3 = 9.Combining constants produces 9 - A = 12, thus A = 9.If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, they eat 9 / 6 = 1.5 beetles each day. But there were 55 weeks in the year. So each jaguar ate 2.5 beetles per week.Thus, the number of beetles eaten by jaguars was 1.5 * 52 weeks = 176, so there were about 800 beetles eaten. The answer is 800.question: Let e be the target number. Then, if a group of traders fully covered their bets, the number of pairs would be (1 +#

 Let X be the number of birds or snakes eaten per day by a jaguar. If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, we have 30 birds and 7 snakes each. Let Y be the number of beetles damaged by a snake each day. Then 12 X Y = 40, clearly a multiple of 3. Let Z be the number of beetles damaged by a jaguar each day. Then 6 X Z = 18, clearly a multiple of 5. Hence, the answer is X = 3Y = 5Z. The answer is 6 * 3 * 5 = 120.question: Oscar and George know that they fight 3 times each year. Each time they fight would last for 3 months. Therefore, if Oscar fights George#

 The number of beetles eaten by a shirt, jaded by a bird for a snake, killed by a jaguar, is < 1.</s>I. INTRODUCTION
The presence of the Lorentz symmetry in the theory of electromagnetism is widely accepted. In addition, the Einstein's theory of special relativity is a widely accepted relativistic theory. Therefore, it is necessary to find out whether there is a basis for physics including both principles, namely Lorentz symmetry and general relativity, or the Lorentz symmetry is just part of theories of electromagnetism in their own domain.
In spite of all difficulties, we can say there is some#

 Let X be the number of beetles eaten by a jaguar.Thus, 6 * 3/5 = 2^5 = 16Beetles are eaten by 5 jaguars. If they each eat 12, they will eat 1 X 6 = 6 X 12 = 144X=2^4 = 64 so X is 2 X 64 = 128 beetles eaten each dayThe answer is 128.question: There are 2 candies and 3 chocolate chips in a bag that contains 26 candies, each with 1#

 Let J be the number of jaguars in the forest, B be the number of beetles eaten by pig King, and N be the number of birds eaten per day. Then (J - B) B = 6N.There are 6 numbers that sum up to six, so B = K/6 where The answer is K = 93,.81/33 = 7.5. The answer is J = 5, B = 94, and N = 1. Then J - B = 5#

 Let X be the number of birds, Y be the number of beetles, and Z be the number of snakes.Therefore, the number of beetles eaten each day is 3*X + 5*Y + 6*Z = 180.Adding the constants produces 140 + 6*Z = 180.Therefore, each bird eats 12 beetles per day.Let B be the number of birds remaining.The number of beetles that each bird ate is just what is left, so 47 - B = 180.The answer is 47.question: Angela drives an Audi Prius. Each day, Angela’s car takes a little longer than usual to get to school. The traffic light at the school is green so she turns right. But because#
