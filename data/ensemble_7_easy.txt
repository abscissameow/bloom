 Therefore, the average weight per unit (calculate that for the entire box as well) would be.Now, simplify the equation so all fractions translate to integer numbers: 54/6 = 3Barb already found out that 5 is the average weight per unit4/6 =.So Barb already found out that., which makes the average weight the most one fifth of a pound.Question #3: Let x be the total weight of the 24 food items.  Then the average weight per item would be x/24.  Now, we want to find the total weight of the food items counted only once.  Because this includes gummy worms, the average weight per item would be x/14.  Then, the weight per gram of the food items is 3/7, and#

 The first level weight of the box of goods was ((2*2+4)/6)/2 = 1.5 pounds. The next weight was ((3*2+4)/6)/2 = 3.5 pounds. The third weight would be ((6*2+2*4)/6)/2 = 6.5 pounds. For Ken, the final weight of the inside of the box in pounds is 6.5 / 1.5 = 4.8.The total weight of the weighted box is (1.5 + 3.5 + 6.5) / 2 = 8.9 pounds.After adding the box weight to the weighted value, the weighted value is 8.9/5 = 15.2. The final weight of not-so-goodies is (15.2 + 8.9) / 2 = 22.5 pounds.

 First, Ken placed a box of equal weight and put in Jelly beans.  The weight on the scale was 50 grams.  Hence the weight on the box was 50 + 2 = 52 grams.So, the box weight was fastened on the scale was 52 grams.Now, the total weight on the scale is now 2 pounds so the total weight on the box now equaled to 2 grams. Then, he poured in the jelly beans and increased the weight smoothly to 300 grams.  Then the box weight was fastened on the scale and the total weight increased to 6 grams.Now, he added the brownies and doubled the weight on the box. So the box weight was fastened on the scale is now 6 - 2 + 2 = 4#

 The final weight of the box would be 22 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 35.We have xxx2 = 35.The answer is 35.question: Penny said eight feet or three inches are equal to 24 inches.  How many inches did Penny#

 Let x be the number of pounds of jelly beans.The weight from the first step is (2x) lb.  As the jelly beans in the box were still in the same bag, the second step adds them to #1, so the weight at the third step is x lb.The answer is x/12.question: Jeff spent $12.10 on a ticket without a drink so that he could eat hot dogs at a discount rate.  Jeff paid $7.76 for the hot dogs and $1.#

 weights on Ken's scale in the morningwere: (0.2 ± 0.20) * (0.53 ± 0.060) = 2.40 ± 2.402 pounds.At 9:05 he put 226 ± 40 jelly beans into the box. At the same time he poured 506 ± 10 brownies into the box. So the combined weight of the brownies and jelly beans was (226 + 506) ± 100 = 2.4 ± 2.4 ounces. Working out the fractions, you get: ((306.8 ± 1.05) / 2.4 ± 1.04) −1.20 ± 1.030 = 0.53 ± 0.060 ounce boxes at the same time he poured 118 ± 2.1 gummy worms into the box.  The weights of the three things Ken poured into the box (jelly beans, brownies, and gummy worms) are (226 ± 40) ± 100 = 2.2 ± 2.#

 With the jelly beans, 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.Now add the brownies, 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.Add the gummy worms to the bottom and stir and still 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.The answer is 24.#

 So, when weights of 1 pound, 2 pounds, 3 pounds, and 2 pounds were added to the original box, that made the overall weight equal to 4 pounds.So the number of jelly beans added was 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.More jelly beans, in total, is 4 × 60 = 240.More brownies were added, so 4 × 74 = 324.And finally, 2 × 166 = 336.So the final weight of the box was 4 pounds: 2 pounds of jelly beans gave that weight, so 2 added together totaled 2 × 2.Also the weight of 2 pounds of brownies added was 4 × 2 × 24 = 72.Then the final weight was 4 + 72 = 88, so there was an#

 After flooring the weight of the box to 2 units, the box was filled with 79 jelly beans.  That just equals the street takings in dollars.  So the miles traveled by the box is equal to 3 * 109 + 2 * 109 + 2 * 109 = 1,276,000.That is a total of 1,276,000 miles traveled by the box.1,276,000 times 0.00053 cades has just turned into 1 million times 0.00053 cades.The answer is 0.0555 cades.question: Gilbert gave Bob $10.

 Weird Equation: Brix is the weight of the jelly beans.  However, because the jelly beans are brownies, we need to divide the final weight into two; two jelly beans and one brownie.  So the final weight of the box of goodies would be: Brix * 2 / 3 x 2.  The answer is 10 pounds.question: Mark wants to wrap an item to the inside of a box that is 5 centimeters longer than the item.
