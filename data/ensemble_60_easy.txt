 Let T be time spent on filming. Then  +  = 42 Therefore, the number of hours Jerry spends watching his daughters play all together would be = 288 hours. Next, let V be the number of games that each daughter has this season.  Then  = 80, which is the number of games that each daughter is expected to play this season since they each have 8 games. Now rearrange the equation in terms of purposes for doing it  +  = 144 +  = 288However, they get paid  = 200 +  = 300 which is more than $250. The fact tells us that the daughters play more than one game every week. The number of weeks they play  =  which is $\cfrac{80}{3#

 Let Y be the number of hours Pedro spent at the field.Then P would need to play 4 * (8/(2 + 8)) = 4 games * (2 hours/(2 + 4)) = 8 games * (1 hour + 1.5 hours) = 8 hours to play 4 games with 2 + 4 hours on practice.Subtract 1.5 from 1 to get 1.5 hours.Subtract that from 8 to get 6 hours.So there are 6 hours here.Some other activities would have taken 6.17 hours. Also, there may have been some work which had nothing to do with soccer. The total could be 8.62 hours but it is harder to calculate.So, Y + 6.17#

 Let b and c be the times that the two girls practice per game. Let I be the total number of games played each season. Let S be the total time for practice and field training per season. Let H be the total time for games.Therefore, b + c = I * S = 8 * 4 * 2 = 120 hours. Thus b = c = 80 hours.Then 3x + 15 = H, so the total time, S, is 3x + 15 = 340 hours.Therefore, the total time that Jerry spends as a field judge is 340 hours.The answer is 340.question: Molly is 20 years old and she likes tomatoes twice as much as she likes potatoes.  This means that she would serve 640 total#

 Let the number of games that Cersei and Cloe played be g.Let the practice time for each game between the two girls be p.  Then the total practice time for each girl is 4g.Let the total games played by the two girls be 2s.So x = 2s.Let the total practice time for all the games play by Jerry be y.So (4g +2y)/12 = x.Clearly x ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5}.Therefore, the answer is 0.question: A soccer tournament has just finished. The plays for all of the ladies’ teams went exactly up to date unless one draw resulted in a 0-0 for a total of 9 draws. The records for the first#

 Let Y be the total number of hours Jerry spent watching the play and their practices.Then, 8/4 will be Y/5.And let A and B be the numbers of hours spent watching and practicing by each of his girls.Then, 8A + 2B will be Y/2So, 8A + 2B = 4(8A) + (2B) = (8A)(8B)Therefore, the total number of practice times he fores to watch his girls on the field is A + B = 24.The answer is 24.question:  If you exercise a muscle group twice a day at an average rate of 100 pounds per 72 hours, how many pounds of muscle should you work to increase your muscuulature by 1#

 Let X be the total number of hours Jerry will spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice.Then we should have X = 4x + (8 - 4 * 2) = 20.But he only practices 4 hours for each game and he spends 1 hour for his work at the field, so we should have 11 = X - 4 - 1 = 15.The answer is 10.question: Zeke played baseball and football, and from their time, he knows his total fast base#

 Grits: The right side simplifies because the equation is a constant term = 2.Then, simply divide the left side by the constant, providing the answer is multiplied by the square root of 2.Thus, 54/24 = 2.So he#

 Let Y be the number of games. Then, 8 * 4 / Y = 20 hours. The number of hours at the field of Jerry is 20 + 8 = 24 hours.Since each game lasts for 2 hours, 24 x 2 = 48.The solution for x is 48 / 2 = 24.The answer is 24.</s>#

 Let N be the number of hours Jerry spends watching his daughters play and practice on both teams altogether.Let T be the number of hours he spends on each team.Let K be the number of games each team plays. Let T be 4 hours. However, K=8 which is greater than T.Therefore, T = 8 - K = 4 since K=8.Let X be the number of hours on which Jerry spends watching one team practice. Let x be 1 since the game is only for 1 day so it is an integer.Then, the number of hours Jerry spends watching the practice for each team would be **** = 4 x 1 + 5 x 1 + 4 x 1 = 41 hours.Joining the like terms on#

 Let h be the number of total hours that Jerry spends at the field watching the games.Then, the number of practice hours could be seen as x+y, where x is the number of hours that Jerry spends watching his high schoolers' baseball games and y is the number of hours he spends watching his two daughters' softball games. Letting y = 2 we get 2h 4 = 24. Furthermore, each practice hour could be subdivided into two soccer practice hours and two track practice hours for a total of 3 soccer practice hours and 4 track practice hours. Since there are 12 practice hours this year we get 3 * 12 = 36 soccer practice hours and 4 * 8 = 32 track practice hours. Letting x = 36 and#

 Let x be the number of games Jerry watches from his daughters. Let y be the number of games he practices from his daughters. Then x + 4y is the number of games Jerry watches and practices.Adding the two problems yields x + 4y = 10 games.And 55/2 x = x.And 2 x = x.Therefore, x = 3.And clearly, Jerry will watch 3 times the number of games he practices.This theme of utilizing the proportion formula can be used with many fractions. Some examples of how this is done with 'fractions like' problems can be found in the sections on 'Ratio Parity is an Absolute Skill' and 'Simple patterns demonstrate the principals of 'Fractions Like Problems' like#

 Let x be the number of games watched.Then the number of hours spent watching and coaching would be 2x * 4 = 8 hours.To watch the games, Jerry should have x -2 hours of the other work.So, the time spent at the field watching and coaching is x + 8 - 2 = 9 hours.There is one hour of work other than just watching and coaching. So there are 96 hours of work.Then Jerry should have 48 games. So the number of games watched equals 9/48 = 2 games per day.The number of work hours equals 9/96 = 0.10844 hours per day.The answer is 0.10850 hours. N - j - n is called the difference of the two integers and is equal#

 Let P be the number of hours Jerry spends watching his daughters play and practice. Let assume that each game lasts 2 hours per session.So P = 8 x 4 = 16.Then add the 16 in parentheses, so it becomes (16 + 8) x 2 = 48.Divide 48 by the number of games Sarah plays, i.e. sister.So 8/12 = 6.These are the hours that Jerry spends watching his daughters play and practice altogether. The answer is 6.question: Alex is 45 minutes away from the store. He could go in two ways. Can he make it before Amazonia gets to the store 15 minutes early?Can he make it when the moon gets to the store 10 minutes later than#

 Let x be the number of games Jerry watched on his daughter’s team.Let y be the number of games that Jerry watched when his daughter’s was on the opposite team.Let t be the number of games that Jerry played.Then y + t = x + 8.Since Jerry won (y - x) games on his own team, then y - x games were won by his daughter’s team. So (y - x) x 4 = 3 x (y - x) = (y - x)8 = 30 hours of practiceTime spent at the field watching practice = (y - x)x = (30 - x) x 4 = 3 x 29 = 143 hours.So, Jerry spent a total of 143 hours watching#

 Let x be the number of games played and each consisting of two practice and four games.Then x + 4y = 12.Let t = 2, where t is the total hours spent watching and prcying.Then x + 4y - t = 12.Or x + y = t + (2x + 4y) = 2(2x + 4y).Thus, x = 2y, or y = 6.Therefore, Jerry will spend 6 hours watching and prcying.The answer is 6.question: President Bush inherited 4 million dollars, he invested $1 million over 3 years and received $25,000 per year for each of the next four years.
