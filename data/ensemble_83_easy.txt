 Let x be the number of hats each of the girls has.Let R be the number of red hats.Then 2x * 2/5 = 4x * 1/4 = 8.So each girl now has 8/8 * 2 = 4/8 = 3/4 red hats.Note that as long as you're dividing by two and keeping the remainder in the other half, any expression you get must be divisible by 2.So each girl has 4x = 4/8 = 3/4 red hats.The number of blue hats is 2x = 2/4 = 3/4.This combination has 28 hats.The answer is 35.question: Brian and his aunt discovered two gas trends at the gas station yesterday.

 Let A be the number of red hats owned by Paityn.Let B be the number of blue hats owned by Zola and let R be the number of red hats that Zola takes from Paityn.Let B + R = A.Then R = A/2Unlike red hats, blue hats are not considered stolen from Paityn so B = 23A is the number of each hats, so A = 23.Thus, R = 21=23.Further, B + R = A.B - A = 21.Thus, the number of hats Paityn takes is 2.Because the number Paityn owns has not changed, Paityn still has 21 hats.So Paityn takes 4 out of 21 = 21% = 5.The answer is 5.

 Let x be the number of rainbow hats that Paityn received. Then we have 20 - x - Z1 = x.Let y be the number of rainbow hats that Zola received.Then we have 24 - x - Z1 = y.Let B be the number total rainbow hats that were in both collectionsThis then becomes G F = 2*y + 20 = y + 20 = y + 2*25othwhere G = y/2 and F = 20 - y/2.Then the number of rainbow hats that Paityn received is G + F = 2*5 = 10 while the number of rainbow hats that Zola received isG - F = 25 - 10 = 15.Therefore, Paityn received 15 rainbow hats and precisely half as many as Zola. The answer is x = 15, y = 10, B = 35, G = 15/2 = 7, F = 20 - 15/2 = 5.question: Do you#

 Let A and B be the numbers of red and blue hats.Subtracting the total number of hats from the total number of hats each person has yields A - B.Also, the total number of hats is 4/5A + 4/5B/ 2 = 6/5A + 6/5B / 2.So, the number of hats each person has is 1/4A + 1/4B / 2 the answers.question: Two trades were made by the same collectible#

 Let R be the number of red hats and B be the number of blue hats. Then R = B (4 + 5 / 2) = 120 + 45 / 2 = 225.Decompose 30 into 10 + 20 and distribute four to R and five to B. So 80 is added to R and 30 to B.Therefore, R = (10 + 20 + 40) = 60.Then (4 + 5 / 2)B = 45 + 45 / 2 = 120.The answer is 120.question: Foxy has 10pence, 5pence and 1pence.

 Let A be the number of red hatsPaityn has A + (2A + 3)/4 = 16 red hats.Zola has 4/5 * 16 = 8 blue hats. Therefore, Paityn has 8- 4/5 * 16 = 9 blue hatsZola has A + (1 + 2 * 4/5 = 2 1/2 times as many be d án ka.. therefore, Paityn has 1 + 3/4 = 4 red hats. So, they share equally 4 hats each.

 Let H be the number of hats Zola receives. Then let R be the number of red hats Paityn has.Let B be the number of blue hats Paityn has. Then let Z be the number of hats Zola has.Then Z = 4/5 * R + B.Let S be the number of uncommon hats they both have. Then the total number of hats each receives is Z + B + S = 43.The answer is 33.question:#

 Let x be the number of red hats and z be the number of blue hats.constituent equation becomes  x + z = 20.The number of red hats that Paityn has is 20 - 1/4 = 15.And the number of blue hats she has is 24 - 1/4 = 9In addition to this, her friend Zola has 4/5 the number of red hats (4/5 x 20 = 8) and twice the number of blue hats (4/5 + 2 x 24 = 36).So, they each get (8 + 36 = 48) hats.The answer is 48.question: A sloth has 29 square feet of sleeping quarters.

 Let y = number of bars that Zola gets let x = number of red hats Paityn has.Then y * x = C's share of the combined distribution So, x * (20 + 4/5) = C1.Then y - C1 = Paityn's share of the combined distribution.So, a * (20 - 1) = C2.Then P1 + C2 = a * x = B.The fraction let's be called k tells us how many of the 52 bars are Zola's Thus, k = B/C.Multiplying by 20 and 4/5 -1 gives y1 = 4/5 * 20 -1 = 8.The fraction tells us how many of Paityn's 20 red hats are Zola's These are the numbers that 55 and 22 are divided by y, or {5,2}.Multiplying by y-1, that's {5,2}0x = 20 * 4/5 = 0.05y-1 = 8y = 0.82Thus, Zola got 20 out of 80#

 Since Paityn has more red hats than Zola, she gets half of Zola's blue hats, and then she needs to get one more red hat from her mother.Maybe her mother loves hats that way she gives her another red hat. The total number of hat will be 20 + 1/2 x 4/5 + 1/2 x 2 = 66. The number of red hat Paityn get is 8. So the number of red hat Paityn get is 4/8 = 1/2. Then the number of blue hat she get is 21 - 8 = 13. The answer is 21.</s>#

 Let m be the number of hats that Paityn gets and n be the number of hats that Zola gets. Now it is m + n = 20. Then the total number of hats is 20 * (4/5).and so for each hat, m * (4/5) = 15.add this number to the other m and we have 20(4/5) + 15 = 38.this number can be simplified on both sides to become 8(4/5)/9. finally m * 8/9 = $\frac{38}{9}$ -= $\frac{25}{9}$. therefore n = 18 to complete the question.The answer is 15.question: As every group has 100 people, the teams have to pair up and form 6#

 Let C be the number of hats the paityn gave to Zola.Then, they combined 29 red and 38 blue hats. So, their combined hat number is 29 + 38 = 51.Paityn is Benetinted hand. So the first person will receive 29/2 = 13. The second person will receive a 2/3 of these new hats, which equals 13*4/3 = 6. The third person will get a 4/3 of these new hats, which equals 6 * 2/3 = 3. The fourth person will receive one of these new hats which equals 1 * 4/3 = 1/2. So the number of hats that each person gets is 13, 6, 3, and 1. The answer is 6.question#
