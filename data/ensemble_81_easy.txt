 Jeff skipped many times in each round by attacking the target 1, 3, 2, 4 and 8 times each round, subtracting 10, 11, 9, 8, 9 from each other.Therefore, he completed an average of 29.5 skips per round.Because he completed 52 skips in all, the average number of skips per round was 29.5*52=1365 skips.The answer is 1365.question: Billy got 100 points in the kick ball game#

 Let A be the number of skips in each round. Then A = 1 + 3 + 4 = 5. Let R be the number of rounds. Then R = 1 + 2 + 3 + A = 5.Putting all the numbers together, it becomes 35 = R + A = 5 + 5 = 10.Then the number of skips completed in the first round would be 1 + 10 = 11 skips on average. In the second round, Sam completed 3 skips more than Jeff so they likely completed 11 skips total. In the next round Jeff completed 1 more skip than Sam so they likely completed 11 skips total, and in the last round Jeff completed 9 fewer skips than Sam so they likely only completed 9 sk#

 The first round is 1 + 3 = 4.The second round is 4 + 3 = 7.The third round is 7 + 4 = 11.Both these round sums are 16 and knowing that on the last round Jeff completed 16, we can sum these two equations to 16 + 16 = 32. That means both Sam and Jeff completed 16 skips per round. Therefore, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 16/32 = 4.5. The answer is 4.5#

 Let A be the number of skips completed by Sam in each round.Then, 16 + 4 *A = 20 skips.Because A = 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round, this would produce a sequence of 5 1s and 2 0s. Thus, 5-1-2-1-2.This sequence would have 15 more zeros than 1s, therefore, the number of zeroes in the second and third rounds would be 75 - 15 = 70.This would also produce a sequence of 15 1s and 20 0s. Thus, 2-1-20 = 55.Let X be the number of skips completed by Jeff, then X = 2*A = 56.Let Y be the number of rounds, then Y = 4.Therefore, the average number#

 Let x be the number of skips in each round.In the first round, Sam completed 2+3 = 5 skips in have x = 5 out of 4 rows so there were 10 skips in total.Then, seconds Jeff did nothing in the second and third round so x = 4/5 = 8 skips total.Therefore, there were 16 skips in the first round, 14 skips in the second, and 10 skips in the third.The 1st total is 8X = 64.This is Jeff's number of skips throughout the tournament.Jeff's average skip would be.1 * 64 =.08 or 8.0 skips per round.The answer is 8.flaskingChallenge6; Multiple choice question#

 Let S be the number of skips per round completed by Jeff.Then the number of rounds completed by Jeff is S*4.Then the number of skips completed by Sam is S*2.Then doubling the S would produce S.The average number of skips completed by each participant would be S / 2 = 0.20.If we want an average result, we multiply both sides of the equation by 0.5 so it becomes 6.4.The data collected is 55 skips. If we use this data to solve the problem, the number of skips per round is 31.The average number of skips per round completed by Jeff would be ((55 - 31) / 55) * (4 / 6.4)#

 Let N be the number of round completed by Sam (excluding the first round). Then 1 + 3 + 4 + 16 = 16.Now we can solve the initial equation N.16 = B to get N = 4.Therefore, each of the four rounds was completed in 4 skips per round by Jeff.The average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 4/16 or 0.25The answer is 0.25.To solve for B, we have 16 * 0.#

 Let x be the number of claims Jeff completed.Then there were 4x + 3 works by Jeff in the first round.There was 3x + 4 = 9 by Sam in the first round.There was 5 + 4 = 9 by Sam in the second round.There was 9 + 3 = 12 by Sam in the third round.There was 6 + 12 = 18 by Jeff in the third round.There was 3 + 18 = 15 by Sam in the fourth round which give us a total of 112. Therefore, x = 16.question: A classroom has 10 desks in an usual classroom setup and then 5 booths and 2 desks in an acred room compact setup. Five of the 10 desks on the usual classroom setup share#

 Let n be the number of skips completed in each round.Let a be the average number of skips in the first 3 (rounds).Let b be the number of skips completed in the fourth round.Then n = a + b.Using the formula for the sum of a number and a constant, the average number of skips in the first 3 rounds is (a + b)/3.Then let (a+b)/3 be an x and let 16 * x be a y. Then the average number of skips in the 4 rounds plus the number completed in the last round is (16 * (a + b)/3 + 16)/4 = x + (16 * b)/4.Subtracting x from both#

 We let x be the number of skips completed by Jeff and let y be the total number of skips completed by both Sam and Jeff. Then we have 3 * 16 + 1 * 6 = 34.Adding 6 to both sides produces 32 + 34 = 78.equating coefficients produces 52 = 6y + (32 - 6x) = 78So we have 52 = (6y + 5 * x) + (18 - 3x) = 78 − 5x − 3yThe average number of skips per round is y/2 + x/2. If Jeff completed x/2 skips in the first round and completed y/2 skips in the second round, then the average is y/2 + x/2 = 12 skips per round#

 Let A be the total number of skips and S be the number of skips completed. Then there are 4 + 16 + 4 + 16 = 80 skips done.So A= 80/2 = 40 skips.Then S = 4*16/2 = 12 skips.Therefore, S = A/6 = 4 skips.The average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 6/4 = 2.The answer is 4.Ans ⇒ a: Darius lost 10 apples. 12 apples#

 Let A be the number of times Sam completed skips in the first round.Let B be the number of times Jeff skipped skips in the second round.Let C be the number of times Jeff completed skips in the third round.Let D be the number of times Jeff completed skips in the fourth round.Then, A + B + C + D = 8.Divide this by 8 to get B + C =4.Therefore, on this day Sam completed (4 - 3) skips or 2 skips per round. The average number of skips per round completed by Jeff rounded to the nearest whole number is 17.20. The answer is 17.20.question: Carla has 100 peanuts. She gave#

 Let r be the number of skips completed per round.  For the first round, let s be the number of skips completed by Sam and e be the number of skips completed by Jeff. Then r + s - e = 12.Let > 0.Then r+ s ≤ e - = 12.And from the definition of s, we have r + s ≤ 16.So we have r + s = 12.And we get r = e ≥ 0.Therefore, we have 12 ≥ r + s ≥ 4.And from the definition of s, we have 12 - 4 = 8.The equation simplifies to 8 = s − e.The answer is 8.question: Sam completed 18 jumps in the first round 1#

 Let y represent the number of skips for Sam. Let x represent the number of skips for Jeff.Let y2 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 49. and then taking the sum of all of the squares. Thus, the answer would be 4(x^2 + x + 1) / 49 = 18x + 11.Because the first 3 values sum up to 21 ( Sam was 1 extra skip than Jeff in the first round. versa from Jeff being 4 times Sam in the second and#

 The average number of skips per round completed by Jeff would be: ( 16 x 3 ) / 4 = 9.The answer is 9.question: Alex read 3 books at 3.2 miles an hour. Edward read 1 book at 1.6#
