 Let x be the number of students who have an average allowance of $6 each day.Pus, if y is the number of students who have an average allowance of $4 each day.Then, the total amount of money is (x+y) * 6(x+y) * 4 = 54 * 3 * 6(x+y) * 4 = 54 * 6 * 4(x+y)So the total amount is 6 * 4 * 3 * 54 = 404 * 6.The answer is 404 * 6.question: 10 students take three CC tests. The first takes 60 minutes, the second takes 60 minutes, the third takes 1/2 the time the second takes. If the time for each CC test is 30 minutes, find all tuples with all#

 Let P be the total amount of money that students get in one day.Suma be the money that students get an average each day.Then, we have 2*(A + B) = P.Let R be quantity of those students receiving $6 allowance. In this case, R = 11.Let T be the amount of money each of the 11 students gets. Then T = 12.Thus, the total money each student gets is A + B = T + P = (12 + 4) + (11 + 6) = 56.Therefore, half of the students receive $10 a day so the total money they get is (11 + 6) = 28.The answer is 28.question: A group of 15 baseball players, observe#

 Let x be the average of the 60 students' school allowances each day. Then the total amount each student receives in a day would be (x + x + x + x + x + x +...)/60 = 52.5.Each group would get the same total amount every day.Therefore, the answer is 52.5.question: Hollis is going to Lincoln Park Zoo. How long will it take him in the automobile?answer: The "nam" of the speed limit is#

 Take 60 - 33 = 27, not 60 - 50 = 30.That means the students get 27 in the form of a daily allowance. The daily allowance is the average of all water bottles (60) the students drink in a day (60 bottles).Now, fibonacci numbers is a series of numbers:Fibonacci numbers = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,...Fibonacci numbers reminds us of the sequence or pyramid. The first two numbers (just like an A and B in a rectangle) would be the ends. The next two (like B and C in a rectangle) would be the sides, and so on.The Fibonacci numbers play an important role in mathematics (and more). The most famous is Fibonacci#

 Let X be the amount of money that the 60 students got in each day. Let n be the number of days, and N = 2*n.Then, X equaled the average of the corresponding N(n + 1) for a total of 930.Plus the total average of the d1 th to 6 * n for a total of 600.So X = 930 + 600 = 1150 The amount of money that students get in a day is 260.The answer is 260.question: A#

 Let F be the total number of calculated amounts.Then F = ( 50 * $15) + (60 * $14) + (30 *$6) = $450 (total amount given).Therefore, the average amount is calculated as: (50 + 60 + 30)/60 = 10/6 which is 6es/day.Compare this answer to the company answer which is 16/6. So, his result is slightly high by a little. For a 10cm rectangle, calculated area = 8cm *#

 Let b be the total amount of money in a day.So, there are (60 + 1) *b dollar for the school.The money that the students earn for store sales ranges from $5.60 up to $6 per day.Running in track team earns the students up to $12 a day in cash for running.If the students get a total of b dollars then b averages $6.00 per day.So, the average total amount of the students earnings for school activities is $16.8.The money earned for the other things such as food and travel ranges from $5.60 to $6 per day.For the average amount of the other things, the item with the largest number of students earn it is travel with 29#

 Let x be the 45 daily allowance.Then average daily allowance is x x = 720.Therefore, the average daily allowance summed over all the students is 720 * 60 = 48000.The answer is 48000.question: There want a tunnel#

 First, let x be the number of students getting an average of $6 a day. Then there are 60 - x students getting an average of $4 a day.The value of x is therefore 40.Subtracting that value from each other gives us: 64 - 40, 32 - 40, and 24 - 40.Adding those numbers gives 72 - 40 = 16.This gives us a sum of 176 - 40 = 16 since there are 60 students.Then we have 800 - 300 = 400.Dealing with fractions, there is a total of 400/800 = 50 or 5 averages.Therefore, if we divide by 8, we have 5/8 = 7.5 or 7.5 out of 8 = 85.The fraction is therefore#

 ABCDEFGH is a sample. And let X be the number of students that get $6 while Y is the number that get $4 a day.Let R be the sum of all students X X + YThus the sum of those who get $6 is 58.And the sum of those who get $4 is 36.So the total amount of money that these students get is X + Y = (58 + 36) + 58 = 322.At 65 cents per meal, it is $15.5.Therefore, the average amount of money the student gets per day is $15.5 รท 65 = $2.38.The answer is $2.38.QuestionArray:weight x yGain usamg x nightweight y firstnightWeight First NightWeight Second#

 Let v be the total amount of money that the 60 students get in a day.Therefore, v = 6 * 42 hours/ 60 = 6.386.We can simplify to 6x hours.So, we have 6x = 3680.Therefore, the average each student receives is house divided by 100, which equals 6/3680 = 14.4. And each student gets $14.4 in a day.Then divide $4 for day by 7 for the week to find out how much each student can realistically get per week. Dividing 70 by 4 gives 15.92 which is the weekly allowance.And this is the amount of money each week that he can reasonably get.The answer is 14.4 and 15.92#

 Let the allowance be A. Then, let k be the number of students that gets $6. Then k * 18 = A.Let n be the number of students getting $4. Then, n * 21 - k * 18 = A.Then, by using the Mean value theorem, the average amount of the $5 students is (n * 21) * 1/2 + k * (1/2) = (1 + 2k) * 18 = (1 + 2k) * 6 = 0 + 2k = 0 + 18k = 18k.Using the mean value theorem again, the average amount of students getting $3 a day would be 6 - 6*0 = 1 = the average amount of students getting $2 a day.The integer multiplies in#

 The average daily allowance that 2/3 of the students receive is 8 dollars per day.Therefore, the total amount of money that those 60 students would receive in a day is 6 x 8 = 48 dollars.The answer is 48.question: In the following#

 The average amount of money that each student with an $12 allowance receives per day is $6 + $4 = $10.  Then the total average endowment a day is (60 + 116 = 146)$13 = B.Then the highest amount that student with an $12 allowance gets in a day is B + 44 = 66$65 = B + 44$116 = B + 64$114 = B + 60Answer: The total average endowment for the whole class in a day is B = (146 - 64 - 40) / 60 or $564 per day.

 In order to figure out the average daily allowance of middle school students, we have to find out how many students get $4 daily allowance and how many get $6.So, if the student spends 1/6 of the money (almost 3 bucks on average) on things like game, etc, and 1/3 of the money on food, clothes, transportation, etc, the total amount he spends, excluding the money he receives from his parents, on a day costs 5 bucks.Now, if we divide the total amount by the number of students at the school, we get the average and that number is either 1/6 or 1/3 according by the result.Let's say 1/3 is the number. It means that the average amount each student receives in#
